# First try

Before getting into any detailed knowledge, it's a good idea to try your first project. You'll have a first impression of what your board can do. Let's blink an LED. 

## Set up software 

At first, you will set up the software for your board.

1. **Open the Visual Studio Code**. I believe most of you guys have installed it. We have created an extension for it. It is really handy and easy to use.

2. **Install the extension MadMachine** as shown below:
    1. click the Extensions button on the left bar.
    2. enter the extension name MadMachine in the search box.
    3. click the Install button.

  src={require('./img/install.png').default}
  alt="Install the extension" width="960"
/>

3. **Download the latest [mm sdk](https://github.com/madmachineio/mm-sdk/releases)**. It is used to build your project. Choose the version marked with the label **Latest**. The versions marked with Pre-release are still for internal testing.

4. **Open the Settings** by clicking **Code** / **Preferences** / **Settings** to set the extension.

<img
  src={require('./img/settings.png').default}
  alt="Open the settings window" width="960"
/>


5. Click **Extensions** to expand it and find **MadMachine**. **Indicate the mm sdk location** in the box that matches your operating system. If you change the location of sdk later, you will need to update it again.

  src={require('./img/sdkPath.png').default}
  alt="Set the path of sdk" width="960"
/>

OK, the software gets preparedüëè.

## Create a project

Now, you will start your first project.

1. Click the **Explorer** button on the left bar. Then click the extension **MadMachine** on the bottom to show three functionalities. Click **New Project**.

<img
  src={require('./img/create.png').default}
  alt="Create a new project" width="960"
/>

2. Choose the project as an executable. Your project will run on the board after it is downloaded, so you need an executable. And the projects later in the following sections are all executables.

<img
  src={require('./img/projectType.png').default}
  alt="Choose project type" width="960"
/>


3. Choose the board for this project - **SwiftIOFeather**.

<img
  src={require('./img/boardType.png').default}
  alt="Chosse board type" width="960"
/>

4. **Name** the project. You could choose any descriptive name you like for the project. Then press the **Enter** key.

<img
  src={require('./img/projectName.png').default}
  alt="Set project name" width="960"
/>

5. Choose a **location** to store the project and press **Open**.

<img
  src={require('./img/location.png').default}
  alt="Set project location and name" width="960"
/>

Well, the project is created and will open in a new window.

## Write code

Then you will need to edit the code for the project. 

1. Click on the **Blink** / **Sources** / **Blink** / **main.swift** to open the file. This file stores the main code for your project. So you will always edit this file for all your projects.

2. Copy the code below into the file. In the next section, you will learn more about the code.

```swift
import SwiftIO
import MadBoard

let led = DigitalOut(Id.BLUE)
‚Äã
while true {
    led.write(true)
    sleep(ms: 1000)

    led.write(false)
    sleep(ms: 1000)
}
```

<img
  src={require('./img/code.png').default}
  alt="Code" width="960"
/>

## Download code to the board

Now you come to the last steps - download your project to the board.

1. **Connect** your SwiftIO Feather board to your computer. In the illustration below, the SwiftIO Feather board is pluged into the SwiftIO Circuit Playgrounds board. You can also disconnect them. 

<img
  src={require('./img/connect.png').default}
  alt="Connect your board to computer" width="480"
/>

2. **Press** the download button.

<img
  src={require('./img/press.png').default}
  alt="Press the download button" width="240"
/>

3. Wait until the onboard LED turns to **steady green**.

<img
  src={require('./img/greenLED.png').default}
  alt="Onboard LED turns to steady green" width="240"
/>

4. **Click** the Download button. It will take a few seconds.

<img
  src={require('./img/download.png').default}
  alt="click download button" width="960"
/>

After it's done, the onboard blue LED starts to blinküí°.
