# A bit of background

In brief, our project is about a new combination of microcontroller and Swift language. You could program your board in Swift language to build exciting projects.

## Microcontroller

What is a so-called **microcontroller**? It is like a microcomputer that is usually embedded in all kinds of electronic devices, like home appliances. It is the heart of these devices to execute some specified tasks. It can take input from the physical world (sensors) and control output devices (actuators). 

When you use your computer, you use keyboard to edit text. The keyboard serves as an input device. The sccreen will display the result and is an output device. As for microcontrollers, you can connect it to various devices. For example, you connect it to a switch and a light: the switch serves as an input to detect your action and the LED as an output to generate light. There are tons of devices with different usage, so you could make the microcontroller to do different work. 

A microcontroller usually contains a CPU, RAM, ROM (can be understood as RAM that can only be read from but cannot be changed), and different kinds of I/O peripherals, to interact with the external devices. Other devices will be attached to its pins to allow it sense and react to the physical world.

Nowadays, microcontrollers develop quickly and become more and more powerful. You could program them to realize some more advanced projects.

## Swift

As for the **Swift** language, itâ€™s a modern language introduced by apple in 2014. It combines the advantages of other languages and known as a simple, efficient, safe language. Maybe you also know that it is usually for application development. However, Swift has much potential in the microcontroller world, especially for complicated projects or graphic applications.

Here is just a brief introduction about them. You will understand them better as you continue with the following tutorials.
