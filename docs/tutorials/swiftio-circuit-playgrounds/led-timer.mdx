# LED blink using timer

You’ll try a new way to blink the LED with a timer. 

You have successfully made the LED to blink, and also learnt about the interrupt in the last exercises. So this time, you will use a timer to set the interrupt to blink the LED.

**Learning goals**
* Learn how to use a timer to trigger the interrupt.
* Blink the LED in a new way.



## Background

### What is a timer?
You have known about the interrupt that is triggered by the state change of an input pin. With this mechanism, the microcontroller doesn't need to check a specific condition all the time to know if it’s ready for the interrupt. It could just do other work and will respond to the interrupt once the condition is met.
And this time, you will know about another way to trigger the interrupt using a timer. It allows the interrupt to happen at every specified time interval. 
For example, in the first section, you make the LED to blink using sleep(). It pauses the microcontroller there for a certain amount of time and does nothing, which would be quite a waste of time if you want it to do something else. If you use a timer, the microcontroller could do many other things and would stop automatically if it’s time for the interrupt execution. 



## Preparation

Class
Timer: this class is used to enable interrupt at a specific time interval.
Method
init()
Initialize a timer.
setInterrupt(ms:mode:start:_:)
Set the condition to trigger the interrupt.
The first parameter is the time interval, measured in ms.
The mode decides how many times the interrupt will happen. There are two options: .oneShot and .period. And by default, it’s set to .period to make the interrupt happen continuously.
The parameter start is to decide whether it will start as you invoke this method, or you will start it manually later by using start().
The last one is to set the task with higher priority. It needs functions with no parameter and return value..

## Exercise
1. LED blink using timer


### 1. LED blink using timer
You will turn the LED on and off every second as you did before, but in a new way.

**Example code**

```swift
// Import the SwiftIO library to control input and output the SwiftIOFeather to use the id of the pins.
import SwiftIO
import SwiftIOFeather

// Initialize a digital pin for LED and a timer.
let led = DigitalOut(Id.D19)
let timer = Timer()

// Set an interrupt to reverse the LED state every second.
timer.setInterrupt(ms: 1000) {
    led.toggle()
}

// Other times, the microcontroller just stops its work.
while true {
    sleep(ms: 9999)
}

```
