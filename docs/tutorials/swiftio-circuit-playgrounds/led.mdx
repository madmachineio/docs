# LED blink


Now it’s time for your first project! Let’s start by learning how to use the most basic and commonly used component: the LED. It’s everywhere in life, for lighting, indication, or decoration...

For those coming from the software programming world, you may be familiar with the traditional “hello world” program. In the world of electronics, we have a similar starter project: blinking an LED! 


**Learning goals**
* Understand how the digital output signal works.
* Learn about some new components: diode, LED, resistor.
* Get to know ohm's law and figure out the relations between current, voltage, and resistance.
* Learn about types of circuit connections.
* Start to write code and learn some Swift programming knowledge.

## Background

### What is digital output?

In electronics and telecommunication, electronic signals carry data from one device to another to send and receive all kinds of information. They are always time-varying, which means the voltage changes as time goes on. Different voltages can convey infos and be decoded to a specified message. Depending on the ways the voltage changes, the signals are divided into two types: digital signal and analog signal. You'll take a look at the digital signal in this chapter.

  alt="Digital signal wave" width="480"
/>

In most cases, a **Digital signal** has two states: on or off. It is suitable to represent the states of some components, like LED which is either turned on or off, the button which will be only pressed or released...

Here are different expressions to represent two voltage states:

| Logic 1 | Logic 0 |
|---------|------|
| true | false | 
| high | low |
| 3.3V | 0V |


:::note
For our board, 3.3V represent true and 0V represent false. Of course, there are many other possibilities, like 5V for true.
:::

You can use a digital output to control the LED both built onto the board or external LEDs (not included). For the LED module on your kit, when you apply a high signal to the LED, it will turn on, and if you apply a low signal, it will be off. 

GPIO (general-purpose input/output) pins can handle digital output and input signals. You’ll set it as output in your code.

## New component

### Diode


The diode is a polarized component. It has a positive side (anode) and a negative side (cathode). In the circuit, the current can only flow in a single direction, from anode to cathode. If you connect it in an opposite direction, the current will not be allowed to pass through.

  alt="Diode symbol" width="80" align="center"
/>


### LED

LED (Light-emitting diode) is a type of diode. Only when you connect it in the right direction – connect the anode to power and the cathode to ground - is the current allowed to flow, lighting up the LED.

:::tip
How to identify the two legs of LED?
1. Typically the long leg is positive and the short leg is negative. 
2. Alternatively, sometimes you will find a notch on the negative side.
:::

The LED allows a **limited range of current**, normally no more than 20mA. So you should add a resistor when connecting it to your circuit. Or the LED might burn out when driving too much current.


When you connect the LED in the circuit, there are two cases to control the LED:

* Connect the anode to a digital output pin and cathode to ground. When connected this way, when the pin outputs a high signal, the LED turns on. This is how the LED is connected on the Feather board.

<img
  src={require('./img/LEDConnectGND.png').default}
  alt="LED connection to light it with high voltage" width="480"
/>

_Pin is the digital output pin, R is a resistor, <img
  src={require('./img/LEDSymbol.png').default}
  alt="LED symbol" width="40" align="center"
/> is an LED, and GND is ground_

* Another method is to connect the anode to a power source and connect the cathode to a digital output pin. When the digital output signal is high, there is no voltage difference between two ends of the LED, but when the digital signal is low, current is allowed to flow, causing the LED to turn on.

<img
  src={require('./img/LEDConnect3V3.png').default}
  alt="LED connection to light it with low voltage" width="480"
/>

_Vcc is a power source, R is a resistor, <img
  src={require('./img/LEDSymbol.png').default}
  alt="LED symbol" width="40" align="center"
/> is an LED, and pin is a digital output pin_


There are many types of LEDs. The LED on your SwiftIO Circuit Playgrounds is a small variant designed to be convenient for mass production.

### Resistor

The resistor functions as a current-limiting component which, just as its name suggests, can resist the current in the circuit. It has two legs. You can connect it in either direction as it is not polarized. Its ability to resist the current is measured in **ohm (Ω)**.

:::info
How can you tell how much resistance a resistor provides?

Each resistor has a specific resistance. Note the colored bands in the diagram. Each band corresponds to a certain number. [Here](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/tools/resistor-color-code-calculator/) is an online guide and calculator to determine how to total the value of all the bands together. 

**Challenge**

What’s the resistance of the sample resistor R1 pictured above, as well as the resistors R2 and R3 below? See below for the answer! 

<img
  src={require('./img/330Resistor.png').default}
  alt="resistor" width="240"

<img

  alt="resistor" width="240"
/>

<details>
    <summary> Answer</summary>

* R1: 10KΩ with a tolerance of ± 5%
* R2: 330Ω with a tolerance of ± 5%
* R3: 470KΩ with a tolerance of ± 1%

</details>
:::

This kind of resistor is useful primarily when you DIY some stuff. However, the SwiftIO Feather board and the rest of the kit uses surface mount resistors as they are smaller and more suitable for mass production.

## New concept

### Ohm’s law

When starting with electronics, you must get familiar with these three concepts: voltage, current, and resistance:
* **Voltage** measures potential energy between two points. 
* **Current** describes the rate of flow of electric charges that flow through the circuit. 
* And **resistance** is the capability to resist the flow of current.

An intuitive and common **analogy** is water pressure in a tank. Imagine a water tank with water inside and an opening at the bottom. 

<img
  src={require('./img/tank.png').default}
  alt="ohm's law analogy" width="960"
/>

In this scenario, the water pressure (water level) is like voltage, the opening is like resistance, and the amount of water spilling out is like current. 

* Looking at the first figure, very little water will come out (current) because there isn’t much pressure (voltage) and the opening is small (resistance). 
* In the second example, we’ve increased the water level (voltage), but kept the same sized opening (resistance), which results in an increase in the flow of the water (current). 
* Finally, in the last one, we’ve also increased the size of the opening (reduced resistance), keeping the water level (voltage) the same, resulting in another increase in flow (current).

**Ohm’s law** describes how voltage, current and resistance interact with each other:

**V = I * R**

* _V: voltage (unit: volts or V)_

* _I: current (unit: amps or A)_

* _R: resistance (unit: ohm or Ω)_


Using some simple algebra, we can also put forward the following formulas:

**R = V / I**

and 

**I = V / R**


As stated previously, all digital pins on the SwiftIO Feather board output a high signal of 3.3V. If the resistance is 330Ω, the current would be 0.01A. 

:::info Exercise

Given an LED with the following characteristics, how many ohm resistor should you use to complete the circuit, using the 3.3V digital out pin source?

* Power dissipation: 45mW
* Optoelectronic characteristics (at 20mA)
* Forward current: 15mA max
* Forward voltage: 3.0V

Here is the equation:

**R = (V-Vled) / Iled**

* V: supply voltage
* Vled: forward voltage for the LED, that is, voltage drop as the current across the LED. 
* Iled: forward current for the LED (usually 10-20mA). It’s the maximum current. If you don’t have the specs about LED, you could normally suppose it to be 20mA.

The resistor for the LED is:

R = (3.3 - 3.0) / 0.015 = 20Ω

The resistance of the LED itself is very small, so you don’t need to take it into consideration. 

Frequently you will be unable to find a resistor that matches the exact theoretical value. When this happens, you can use a resistor that has a slightly greater resistance.

In general, the resistance calculated is a minimum requirement. You can also choose a resistor with much larger resistance. Doing so will cause the LED’s brightness to change with it. (Greater resistance will cause the LED to be dimmer)
:::

### Serial circuit and parallel circuit

Serial and parallel circuits are the ways to connect more than two devices in the circuit. 

In a **serial circuit**, devices are connected end-to-end in a chain, like R1 and R2. The current flows through them in one direction from positive to negative. And the current flowing through each device is the same.

In a **parallel circuit**, the devices share two common nodes, like R3 and R4. Node (a) connects both two devices, so the current could flow through either of them. The voltage between two nodes (a and b) is the same, so the voltages spent on R3 and R4 are the same.

<img
  src={require('./img/serialParallel.png').default}
  alt="Serial and parallel circuit" width="960"
/>                  

In your real situation, the circuit would not be that easy. The serial and parallel circuit would both be used when building the circuit.

Let’s look at an example. You will know better about two circuits.

* In the first circuit, the two lamps are connected in series, so the switch can control both of them. If any of the lamps breaks down, even if the switch is closed, the other lamp will not be lit. 
* In the second circuit,  the two lamps are connected in parallel, you can control any of them by using the corresponding switch that is connected to it in series: switch1 controls the lamp1, switch2 controls the lamp2. And the two lamps work separately.

<img
  src={require('./img/serialParallelCombination.png').default}
  alt="Both serial and parallel circuit connection" width="960"
/>     

### Open, closed and short circuit

In addition to the previously mentioned types of circuits, there are three more you need to know about: open circuit, closed circuit, and short circuit. 

* The first figure is a **closed circuit**. This allows current to flow freely from the positive terminal through a load that consumes electric power, finally returning back to the negative terminal. 
* In an **open circuit**, there is a gap somewhere on the circuit, therefore disallowing any current to flow through it.
* Current tends to flow through the path with lower resistance, if you accidentally connect the positive to the negative terminal of the power supply, the current will flow directly through this path and bypass the other paths with higher resistance. The resistance of wires are so small that we normally ignore it. This causes a **short circuit**. When the current reaches sufficiently high levels, this can cause serious damage.

<img
  src={require('./img/threeCircuits.png').default}
  alt="Open, closed and short circuits" width="960"
/>  


### Current safety
In a complete circuit, the current will always flow from the point of higher voltage (usually power) to the one of lower voltage (usually ground or GND). Consumed energy is turned into light, heat, sound, etc. 

If you were to connect the power directly to the ground using a wire, this would cause a short circuit. It can (and usually do) cause damage to your circuit and board, and is also very possible to start a fire.  

Another warning: if you’re not careful about selecting an appropriately strong resistor to resist the level of current flowing through the circuit, the devices can be burnt and damaged (and additionally cause a fire hazard). 


## Circuit - LED module

The image below shows how the LED module is connected to the SwiftIO Feather board in a simplified way. 

The LED is connected to **D19**. GND and 3V3 are connected respectively to the corresponding pin on the board. On circuit diagrams, the red line is usually for power and the black line for ground.

The circuits are all built when designing the board, so you don’t need to connect any wires. And as mentioned before, the white sockets are used to build the circuit after the board is disassembled.

:::note
The circuits above are simplified for your reference.

## Preparation 

**Class**

**`DigitalOut`** - as indicated by its name, this class is used to control digital output, to get high or low voltage.

Method

* `init(_:mode:value:)` - Initialize a digital output pin. The first parameter needs the pin id which is listed in the Id enumeration. The parameters `mode` and `value` already have a default value.

* `write(_:)` - Set the pin to output high or low voltage. Its parameter is a boolean type: `true` or `false`. `true` corresponds to a high level and `false` corresponds to a low level. 

* `toggle()` - Reverse the digital output between high and low.

* `high()` - Output high voltage.

* `low()` - Output low voltage.

**Global function**

`sleep(ms:)` - Make the microcontroller suspend its work for a certain time, measured in milliseconds.


## Exercise
1. [Blink an LED](./led.mdx#1-blink-an-led)
2. [LED morse code](./led.mdx#2-led-morse-code)

### 1. Blink an LED

In your first try, let’s make the LED blink - on for one second, then off for one second, and repeat it over and over again.

<img
  src={require('./img/blink.png').default}
  alt="LED blink" width="480"
/>

**Example code**

```swift
// First import the SwiftIO and SwiftIOFeather libraries into the project to use related functionalities.
import SwiftIO
import SwiftIOFeather

// Initialize the specified pin used for digital output.
let led = DigitalOut(Id.D19)

// The code in the loop will run over and over again. 
while true {
    //Output high voltage to turn on the LED.   
    led.write(true)
    // Keep the LED on for 1 second.
    sleep(ms: 1000)

    // Turn off the LED and then keep that state for 1s.
    led.write(false)
    sleep(ms: 1000)
}
```

**Code analysis**

Here are some key statements for this program, make sure you understand them before you start to code.

```swift
// Comment
```

This is the comment for the code used to explain how the program works and also for future reference. It always starts with two slashes. 

```swift
import SwiftIO
import SwiftIOFeather
```

These two libraries are necessary for all your projects with the SwiftIO Feather board. In short, a library contains a predefined collection of code and provides some specified functionalities. You can use the given commands directly without caring about how everything is realized.

`SwiftIO` is used to control input and output. It includes all the necessary commands to talk to your board easily. 

`SwiftIOFeather` contains all the ids of SwiftIO feather board. Both the SwiftIO and SwiftIO feather board use the SwiftIO library, but their pin ids are different, so you need to add the corresponding library of id to distinguish them.

```swift
let led = DigitalOut(Id.D19)
```

`let` is the keyword to declare a constant. A **constant** is like a container whose content will never change. But before using it, you need to declare it in advance. Its name could be whatever you like and it’s better to be descriptive, instead of a random name like abc. If the name of your constant consists of several words, then except the first word, the first letter of the rest words needs to be capitalized. This is known as the camel case.

The **class**, in brief, is more like a mold that you could use to create different examples, known as instances, with similar characteristics. The class `DigitalOut` provides ways to change digital output, so all its instance can set high or low voltage. The process of creating an instance is called initialization.

The constant `led` is the instance of the `DigitalOut` class. To initialize it, the pin id is required. `Id` is an enumeration including the ids of all pins. As for **enumeration**, enum for short, it could group a set of related values. Just remember that the id needs to be written as `Id.D19`. There are two more optional parameters with a default value, so you could leave them as they are. 

In this way, the pin D19 would work as a digital output pin and get prepared for the following instructions. 

```swift
while true {
}
```

It’s a dead loop in which the code will run over and over again unless you power off the board. The code block inside the brackets needs to be indented by 4 spaces.

:::note
Sometimes you find nothing that needs to run repeatedly, you could add `sleep` in it to make the board sleep and keep in a known state.
:::

```swift
led.write(true)
```

The `led` instance has access to all the instance methods in the `DigitalOut`. `write()` is one of its methods. You’ll use **dot syntax** to access it: the instance name, followed by a dot, the method in the end. Then you decide the voltage level as its parameter, `true` for high voltage, `false` for low voltage. A value either `true` or `false` is of **Boolean** type.

```swift
sleep(ms: 1000)
```

This is a global function thus you could directly invoke it. It has a parameter name `ms` and a parameter (the specified period). During sleep time, the microcontroller would suspend all its processes and stay there until the time is up.

:::info
Both method and function group a block of code and you could realize the same functionality by calling their name. Their difference is that a method belongs to a class and a function is independent. 
:::

Why do I need to add it? The microcontroller executes any state change extremely quickly. If you just change the output state between high and low, the LED will be on and off so quickly that you could not notice it. So a small period is added here to slow the speed of change. If you want the LED blink faster, you could reduce the sleep time.


:::info
When using methods or functions, why do some parameters need to add a name and others don't? 
Let’s look at the source code below for example: 

```swift
func write(_ value: Bool)
```
There is an underscore “_” before the value. This means the name could be omitted when invoking the function.

```swift
func sleep(ms: Int)
```
While `ms` doesn’t have the underscore symbol before it, so the name is necessary.


:::

### 2. LED morse code

**Example code**

Have you heard of Morse code? It encodes characters into a sequence of dashes and dots to send messages. To reproduce it, you could use long flash and short flash respectively. In morse code, s is represented by three dots, o is represented by three dashes. So the SOS signal needs three short flashes, three long flashes, and then three short flashes again. 

```swift
// Import the two necessary libraries to use all their functionalities.
import SwiftIO
import SwiftIOFeather

// Initialize the digital output pin.
let led = DigitalOut(Id.D19)

// Define the LED states to represent the letter s and o.
let sSignal = [false, false, false]
let oSignal = [true, true ,true]

// This function sets the LED blink rate according to the values in the array.
func send(_ values: [Bool], to light: DigitalOut) {
    // Decide the duration of slow flash and quick flash.
    let long = 1000
    let short = 500

    // Iterate all the values in the array. The value will decide how long the LED will be illuminated. 
    // If the value is true, the LED will be on for 1m, and if it’s false, the LED will be on for 0.5s.
    for value in values {
        light.high()
        if value {
            sleep(ms: long)
        } else {
            sleep(ms: short)
        }
        light.low()
        sleep(ms: short)
    }
}

// Blink the LED.
// At first, the LED starts 3 fast blink to represent s. Then it’s 3 slow blink to represent o, and 3 fast blink again to represent s.
// Wait 1s before repeating again.
while true {
    send(sSignal, to: led)
    send(oSignal, to: led)
    send(sSignal, to: led)
    sleep(ms: 1000)
}
```

### Code analysis

```swift
let sSignal = [false, false, false]
let oSignal = [true, true, true]
```
Here, two arrays are used to store the info of two letters. Since there are only two states: fast or slow flash, you could use boolean value to represent two states. `false` will corresponds to slow flash later.

An array could store a series of ordered values of the same type in a pair of square brackets. The values here are all boolean values. 

```swift
func send(_ values: [Bool], to light: DigitalOut) {
    ...
}
```
You will create a function to decide the blink rate according to the values. 

BTW, It works if you set the digital pin to high or low voltage one by one manually. But it requires a lot of repetitive work. The new function here is to make your code more organized and clear.

This function needs two parameters. One is an array of boolean values that stores the info to represent a single letter. The second is the digital pin that the LED is connected to.

:::info
Usually, it's better not to use the variable or constants that are declared out of the function itself. **All stuff needed is passed in as its parameters**. As you invoke the function, you will then tell which pin is going to be used and what the values are. Thus you could use this piece of code in other project without modifying the code. This practice would be really helpful as you work on great projects in the future.
:::

```swift
let long = 1000
let short = 500
```

They set the duration of LED on-time. You store the value in the two constants so it would be clearer as you use them later.

```swift
for value in values {
    ...
}
```
This is a **for-in loop**. It has two keywords: `for` and `in`. It’s used to repeat similar operations for each element. It is usuallt used with arrays. The code inside the curly brackets would repeat several times to iterate all the elements in the array.

`value` represents the elements in the array `values`. It doesn’t matter if you use `value` or a, b, c to name it. But it’s better to use a descriptive name.

```swift
if condition {
    task1
} else {
    task2
}
```
This is a **conditional statement**. The **if-else** statement makes it possible to do different tasks according to the condition. The condition is always a boolean expression that will return either true or false. And it will use some comparison operators to evaluate the value as follows:

* Equal to: `a == b`
* Not equal to: `a != b`
* Greater than: `a > b`
* Less than: `a < b`
* Greater than or equal to: `a >= b`
* Less than or equal to: `a <= b`

If the condition evaluates true, task1 will be executed and task2 will be skipped. If the condition is false, task2 will be executed instead of task1.

In the code above, the `value` is judged to know how long the LED should be on.

```swift
light.high()
light.low()
```
Set high or low voltage. This is similar to the method `write()`, but it’s more straightforward. The statement `led.write(true)` of course works.


## Summary
Congratulations! In this section, you successfully blink the LED by setting the output. What’s more, you also learn some basic electronic knowledge and Swift programming. Do you understand how the blink works now? Make sure you clarify the program logic and the basic idea before going to the next part.
