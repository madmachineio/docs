# First try

Before getting into any detailed knowledge, it's a good idea to try your first project. You'll have a first impression of what your board can do. Let's blink an LED. 

## Set up software 

At first, you will set up the software for your board.

1. **Open the Visual Studio Code**. I believe most of you guys have installed it. We have created an extension for it. It is reall handy and easy to use.

2. **Install the extension MadMachine** as shown below. 
    1. click the Extensions button on the left bar.
    2. enter the extension name MadMachine in the serch box.
    3. click the Install button.

<img
  src={require('./img/install.png').default}
  alt="Install the extension" width="960"
/>

3. **Open the windows Settings** by clicking **Code** / **Preferences** / **Settings** to set the extension.

<img
  src={require('./img/settings.png').default}
  alt="Open the settings window" width="960"
/>

4. **Download the latest [mm sdk](https://github.com/madmachineio/mm-sdk/releases)**. Choose the version marked with label Latest. The versions marked with Pre-release are still for internal testing.


5. Click **Extensions** to expand it and find **MadMachine**. **Indicate the sdk location** in the box that matches your operating system. If you change the location of sdk later, you will need to update it again.

<img
  src={require('./img/sdkPath.png').default}
  alt="Set the path of sdk" width="960"
/>

Now, the software gets preparedüëè.

## Create a project


1. Click the **Explorer** button on the left bar. Then click the extension **MadMachine** on the bottom to show three functionalities. Click **New Project**.

<img
  src={require('./img/create.png').default}
  alt="Create a new project" width="960"
/>

2. Choose the project as an executable.

<img
  src={require('./img/projectType.png').default}
  alt="Choose project type" width="960"
/>


3. Choose the board for this project - SwiftIOFeather.

<img
  src={require('./img/boardType.png').default}
  alt="Chosse board type" width="960"
/>

4. **Name** the project. You could choose any descriptive name you like for the project. Then press the **Enter** key.

<img
  src={require('./img/projectName.png').default}
  alt="Set project name" width="960"
/>

5. Choose a **location** to store the project and press **Open**.

<img
  src={require('./img/location.png').default}
  alt="Set project location and name" width="960"
/>

After it's done, the project will open in a new window.

## Write code

Then you will need to edit the code for the project. 

1. Click on the **Sources** / **Blink** / **main.swift** to open the file. This file stores the main code for your project. So you will always edit this file for all your project.

2. Copy the code below into the file. In the next sections, you will learn more about the code.

```swift
import SwiftIO
import MadBoard

let led = DigitalOut(Id.BLUE)
‚Äã
while true {
    led.write(true)
    sleep(ms: 1000)

    led.write(false)
    sleep(ms: 1000)
}
```

  src={require('./img/code.png').default}
  alt="Code" width="960"
/>

## Download code to board

Now you come to the last steps - download your project to the board.

1. **Connect** your SwiftIO Feather board to your computer.

<img
  src={require('./img/connect.png').default}
  alt="Connect your board to computer" width="480"
/>

2. Press the download button.

<img
  src={require('./img/press.png').default}
  alt="Press the download button" width="240"
/>

3. Wait until the onboard LED turns to steady green.

<img
  src={require('./img/steadyGreen.png').default}
  alt="Onboard LED turns to steady green" width="240"
/>

4. Click the Download button. It will take a few seconds.

<img
  src={require('./img/download.png').default}
  alt="click download button" width="960"
/>

After it's done, the onboard blue LED starts to blinküí°.
