# Overview

Hi there, welcome to the MadMachine platformü•≥. Are you interested in electronics or want to learn the Swift language? Then you are in the right place. Here, you could explore the hardware using Swift language.

Many of you might think coding is a tough job and the learning process seems so boring. An effective way to view the result is to print, in the beginning, the phrase ‚ÄúHello world‚Äù, and then the result for each demo. Now you could learn by turning on an LED, driving a buzzer, or displaying some stuff on screens. With just several lines of code, you could get these devices to work. It‚Äôs cool! As you are more comfortable in this environment, you could then DIY more fantastic stuff. 

While learning electronics, wiring is such a pain in the neck. Sometimes, you check the code again and again and finally find that you connect the component to the wrong pin by mistake. So this kit is specially designed to allow everyone to get started with more ease. You don‚Äôt need to worry about wiring during your learning process. What you do is just focus on coding and realize your creativity. Once you get familiar with all the basic usage, you could take it apart into small parts for more complicated and interesting projects.

BTW, if you notice any mistakes or have any feedback, feel free to let us know. We hope to provide more helpful materials together with you guys. Now let‚Äôs dive into more details!
