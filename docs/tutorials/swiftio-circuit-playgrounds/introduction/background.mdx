# Background

In brief, our project is about a new combination of microcontroller and Swift language. You could program your board in Swift language to build exciting projects.

What is a so-called **microcontroller**? It is like a microcomputer that is usually embedded in all kinds of electronic devices, like home appliances. It is designed to execute some specified tasks. It usually contains a CPU, RAM, ROM (can be understood as RAM that can only be read from but cannot be changed), and different kinds of I/O peripherals, to interact with the external devices. Now you could try it on your own to control light, sound, motors, and much other hardware.

As for the Swift language, it’s a modern language that combines the advantages of other languages. It’s known as a simple, efficient, safe language. Maybe you also know that it is usually for application development. However, Swift has much potential in the microcontroller world, especially for complicated projects or graphic applications.
