# BMP file

In this tutorial, you will learn about the way to display bmp images on a screen.

## ðŸ”¸Introduction

As mentioned before, BMP file is a raster image format and stores uncompressed image data. It is device independent and thus can be displayed on a small screen easily.

Each pixel on a bitmap contains a color value. There are two ways to store the color: indexed and RGB color. 

**Indexed image**

An **indexed color image** has a color table or palette that stores the color value. Every single pixel stores an index used to get color from the palette. In this way, the image takes up smaller storage and can transfer faster. There are usually 1-bit, 2-bit, 4-bit, 8-bit indexed colors. 

* 1-bit supports 2 colors for each pixel, often black and white. The early computers used this way to display graphics.  
* A 2-bit image can have 4 color options for one pixel.
* A 4-bit image can have 16 color options for one pixel.
* A 8-bit image can have 256 color options for one pixel.

The image below shows how indexed images work. The original is a 24-bit RGB image. The others use indexed colors and are generated using photoshop. The 1-bit image has only black and white colors. The 2-bit one has two more colors: pink and dark green. The 4-bit and 8-bit contain more colors and thus are closer to the original.


<img
  src={require('./img/indexed.png').default}
  alt="Indexed image" width="960"
/>

:::info
You may find there are some gray scales in the 1-bit image above. Thatâ€™s due to a technique called **dither**. It mimics different colors by mixing pixels of given colors. Different densities of two colors create illusions of other colors to our eyes. With this technique, you could create images with limited colors.

After you enlarge that image, you will see only black and white are used. 
<img
  src={require('./img/dither.png').default}
  alt="Dither" width="480"
/>

If the image is turned into 1-bit indexed color without using dithering, it will be as follows:
<img
  src={require('./img/withoutDither.png').default}
  alt="i-bit indexed image without dither" width="240"
/>

For indexed images, you can change its palette to change how it looks. Nowaday, such images are not common, but you can still create them using Adobe Photoshop or Aseprite.

**RGB image**

A RGB color image doesn't need a palette and stores a true color value for each pixel.  24-bit and 32-bit images are widely used nowadays. They use 8-bit to represent red, green and blue. When displaying these images, your board reads the color data and directly displays it on a screen, so it will be more convenient than indexed images.

Let's see how you can display bitmap files on a screen. 

**Class**

**`BMP`** - display a bitmap image on a screen.

| Method | Explanation |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `init(path:transparentColor:)` | Initialize a bitmap by indicating the path of the image on the SD card. It will open the file and read the data. <br />**Parameters:** <br /> - path: . <br /> - transparentColor: . |
| `getBitmap() -> Bitmap` | Get pixel information from the image. <br />If itâ€™s an indexed image, it will get the indexes. If itâ€™s a RGB image, it will read the color values. |
| `getPalette() -> Palette?` | Read palette from an indexed image. A RGB image doesnâ€™t have a palette, so the return value is an optional type to ensure your program goes well. |

 
Please make sure to copy the images to SD card so that your board can read it. And the image should be within 240x240 pixels to fit the screen.


**Indexed bitmap**

Letâ€™s start with an indexed image.

```swift
import SwiftIO
import MadBoard
import ST7789
import MadDisplay

let spi = SPI(Id.SPI0, speed: 30_000_000)
let cs = DigitalOut(Id.D9)
let dc = DigitalOut(Id.D10)
let rst = DigitalOut(Id.D14)
let bl = DigitalOut(Id.D2)

let screen = ST7789(spi: spi, cs: cs, dc: dc, rst: rst, bl: bl, rotation: .angle90)
let display = MadDisplay(screen: screen)

let bmp = BMP(path: "/SD:/indexed.bmp")
let bitmap = bmp.getBitmap()
let palette = bmp.getPalette()!

let tile = Tile(bitmap: bitmap, palette: palette)
let group = Group()
group.append(tile)
display.update(group)

while true {
    sleep(ms: 9000)
}
```

First you need to tell your board where the image is stored. If itâ€™s in the root directory of the SD card, the path is  "/SD:/xxx.bmp".
As it is an indexed image, you will get its bitmap and palette. Don't forget the palette needs to be unwrapped. Since this image must have a value, you can force unwrap it. Then you create a tile with them. Add the tile to a group and display it. 

**RGB bitmap**

What about RGB images? Letâ€™s find out how to display them.

```swift
import SwiftIO
import MadBoard
import ST7789
import MadDisplay

let spi = SPI(Id.SPI0, speed: 30_000_000)
let cs = DigitalOut(Id.D9)
let dc = DigitalOut(Id.D10)
let rst = DigitalOut(Id.D14)
let bl = DigitalOut(Id.D2)

let screen = ST7789(spi: spi, cs: cs, dc: dc, rst: rst, bl: bl, rotation: .angle90)
let display = MadDisplay(screen: screen)

let bmp = BMP(path: "/SD:/RGB.bmp")
let bitmap = bmp.getBitmap()
let colorConverter = bmp.getColorConverter()!

let tile = Tile(bitmap: bitmap, colorConverter: colorConverter)
let group = Group()
group.append(tile)
display.update(group)

while true {
    sleep(ms: 9000)
}
```

At first, you also need to initialize a BMP with its path. It stores the actual color value for each pixel, so you just get a bitmap. Whether it's a 24 or 32 bit image, the color value will be calculated automatically into 16-bit for the screen.
