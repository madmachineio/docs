# Go further


After going through each element, you will know some details to better understand the usage.

Coordinates
You may notice that bitmap, tile and group have coordinates. That's quite confusing, let’s make it clear together.

The Bitmap has its coordinate system to locate all pixels. The point a is its origin (0,0). All other pixels have coordinates relative to a.
The Tile includes the Bitmap. It also has a coordinate system. The point b is its origin. The bitmap’s position in the tile is decided by the coordinates of point a relative to b. 
Both the Tile and SubGroup are in Group. Their location in the Group are determined respectively by the coordinates of point b and d relative to point c. And the SubGroup overlaps the tile. You can use Group[0] to access Tile and Group[1] to access SubGroup.
The Group is what will be displayed on the screen. The point e is the origin of the screen. The location of the Group is set by the coordinates of the point c. 



Layers
This library divides the whole display into several elements, from bitmap to group. You may get confused at first glance. However, it allows you to do many unbelievable things. You can separate your display into different layers. Then you can change any of them independently and update the changes, thus avoiding refreshing the whole display every time there is a small change.
