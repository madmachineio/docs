Layers
This library divides the whole display into several elements, from bitmap to group. You may get confused at first glance. However, it allows you to do many unbelievable things. You can separate your display into different layers. Then you can change any of them independently and update the changes, thus avoiding refreshing the whole display every time there is a small change.
