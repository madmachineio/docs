# Introduction

On a little LCD screen, you could display many interesting things. In the last chapter, you try a simple usage by writing pixels on it. This is the most basic way. If you want to show something more complicated with plenty of elements and animation, that method is too basic and not suitable anymore. 

So you are going to use a library called `MadDisplay` that allows you to display easily graphics, images, texts, etc. BTW, this library refers to Adafruitâ€™s [displayio](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-display-support-using-displayio) that is really well-structured and inspires us a lot.

Before you use the library `MadDisplay`, you will need to add it to your project to use these functionalities. Just indicate its position and name in the file `Package.swift` as below:

```swift title="Package.swift"
import PackageDescription
let package = Package(
    name: "Display",
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/madmachineio/SwiftIO.git", .branch("main")),
        .package(url: "https://github.com/madmachineio/MadBoards.git", .branch("main")),
        .package(url: "https://github.com/madmachineio/MadDisplay.git", .branch("main")),
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(
            name: "Display",
            dependencies: [
                "SwiftIO",
                "MadBoards",
                "MadDisplay"
            ]),
        .testTarget(
            name: "DisplayTests",
            dependencies: ["Display"]),
    ]
)

```
