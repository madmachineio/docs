# Introduction

Hi there, welcomeü•≥! 

Are you interested in electronics or want to learn the Swift language? Then you are in the right place. Here, you could explore the hardware using the Swift language.

Many of you might think coding is a tough job and the learning process seems so boring. An effective way to view the result is to print, in the beginning, the phrase ‚ÄúHello world‚Äù, and then the result for each demo. Now you could learn by turning on an LED, driving a buzzer, or displaying some stuff on screens. With just several lines of code, you could get these devices to work. That‚Äôs so cool! As you are more comfortable in this environment, you could then DIY more fantastic stuff. 

While learning electronics, wiring is such a pain in the neck. Sometimes, you check the code again and again and finally find that you connect the component to the wrong pin by mistakeüò≥. And there could more much more situations. That would be so frustrating. So in the following tutorials, you will learn with a specially designed beginner kit. You don‚Äôt need to worry about wiring during your learning process. What you do is focus on coding and realize your creativity.

## What you need

* SwiftIO Feather board
* SwiftIO Circuit Playgrounds kit


## What this material is about

SwiftIO Circuit Playgrounds kit is a beginner-friendly tool to get familiar with this ecosystem. So in the following tutorials, you will learn the basic electronics and Swift programming. We assume no prior knowledge of them. You could, of course, skip the parts you've already known.

This material will guide you from zero to one. The tutorials are divided into several parts:

* **Introduction**: this section prepares you for the following learning process. You will set up the software, take a quick look at the hardware, and learn the basic operations.

* **Get familiar with modules**: in this section, you will dive deeper into the electronic concepts and how to program your board using Swift. Each tutorial focus on one module and one electronic usage. You could follow the provided projects to have a better understanding.

* **Graphical display**: this section tells you how to display shapes, text, images... on a tiny screen using a graphical library. You will have fun creating wonderful patterns.

* **More projects**: this section provides some projects based on what you have learned. At first, you will try some warmup projects. Then you will explore more complicated projects to enjoy the charm of hardware programming using the Swift language.
