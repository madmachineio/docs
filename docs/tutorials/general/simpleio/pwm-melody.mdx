# PWM melody

This example is similar to the previous one. You will make the buzzer play a small piece of music.

## What you need

- SwiftIO Feather (or SwiftIO board)
- Breadboard
- Buzzer
- Jumper wires

## Circuit

1. Plug the buzzer onto the breadboard.
2. Connect any one leg to the pin GND and the other to the pin PWM5A.

## Example code

You can find the example code at the bottom left corner of IDE: <img
  src={require('./img/example.png').default}
  alt="example" width="20"
/> / `SimpleIO` / `PWMMelody`.

```swift
// Enable the speaker to play a simple melody by changing the frequency of PWM output.
// Import the library to enable the relevant classes and functions.
import SwiftIO

// Import the board library to use the Id of the specific board.
import SwiftIOFeather

// Initialize a PWM output pin the speaker connects.
let speaker = PWMOut(Id.PWM5A)

// Specify several frequencies corresponding to each note of the melody. 
let fre = [
    330,330,349,392,
    392,349,330,294,
    262,262,294,330,
    330,294,294
]

// Allow the speaker to repeat the melody again and again.
while true {
    for f in fre {
        // Change the frequency and the duty cycle of output to produce each note.
        speaker.set(frequency: f, dutycycle: 0.5)
        sleep(ms: 250)
    }
}
```

## Code analysis

```swift
let fre = [
    330,330,349,392,
    392,349,330,294,
    262,262,294,330,
    330,294,294
]
```

The frequencies on the array correspond to the notes of the music. If you want to play other music, you can write down the frequencies according to the music score.
