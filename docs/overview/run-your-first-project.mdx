# Run your first project

Now let's learn how to program your board and run your first project. You will start with a hello world project - LED blink. 

## Step 1: Install the MadMachine extension in Visual Studio Code

At first, you need a tool to deal with your code. You could install the MadMachine extension for Visual Studio Code. It allows you to create a new project, compile and download it to your board. 

1. In the Visual Studio Code, click the **Extension** icon on the left activity bar.
2. Enter **madmachine** in the search box to find the extension in its marketplace.
3. Click the **Install** button.

When you install the MadMachine extension, the extension Serial Port Helper will be installed as well. It allows you to view values or debug. Of course, you could use other similar tools instead.

:::info
For advanced users, you could edit your code wherever you like and use the [mm-sdk](https://github.com/madmachineio/mm-sdk) to compile your code.
:::

## Step 2: Set the extension

The extension relies on the mm sdk to do all its work. So you need to indicate its path before using the extension. You only set it the first time you use this extension.

1. [**Download** the latest sdk release](https://github.com/madmachineio/mm-sdk/releases) according to your operating system and unzip it. The versions marked as pre-relase are for internal test and may be unavailable. 

2. Then come back to the VS code. In the menu bar, select **Code** / **Preferences** / **Settings**.

  src={require('./img/settings.png').default}
  alt="Set the MadMachine extension" width="960"
/>

3. In the Settings, select **Extensions** / **MadMachine**. Enter the **path** of the sdk in the box that matches your operating system. Windows is not supported since we are waiting for the Window support of Swift language...

  src={require('./img/sdkPath.png').default}
  alt="Indicate the path of sdk." width="960"
/>


## Step 3: Write code

Now, you're ready to code. 

1. Click the **Explore** icon on the left bar. Then click the **MadMachine** extension on the bottom to show three buttons. Click **New Project**.

<img
  src={require('./img/create.png').default}
  alt="Create a new project." width="960"
/>

2. Choose the project as an **executable**. 

<img
  src={require('./img/projectType.png').default}
  alt="Choose project type." width="960"
/>

3. Choose the **board** you are going to use.

<img
  src={require('./img/boardType.png').default}
  alt="Choose the board." width="960"
/>

4. **Name** the project. You could choose any descriptive name you like for the project. Then press the **Enter** key.

<img
  src={require('./img/projectName.png').default}
  alt="Enter project name." width="960"
/>

5. Choose a **location** to store the project and press **Open**. 

<img
  src={require('./img/location.png').default}
  alt="Choose a file location." width="960"
/>

6. The project will open in a new window. Click on the Explorer `Sources` / `Blink` / `main.swift` to open the file. You will always edit the code in the file `main.swift` for your future projects. Copy and paste the following sample code into the file.

```swift
import SwiftIO
import MadBoard

let led = DigitalOut(Id.BLUE)
â€‹
while true {
    led.write(true)
    sleep(ms: 1000)

    led.write(false)
    sleep(ms: 1000)
}
```

  src={require('./img/code.png').default}
  alt="code" width="960"
/>

## Step 4: Prepare SD card and confirm USB connection

After finishing the code, you need to download it to your board. So follow the steps below to connect the board to your computer first.

1. Make sure that you have inserted an **SD card** into the slot.

  src={require('./img/SDcard.png').default}
  alt="Insert SD card" width="480"
/>

2. Connect the board to your computer through the **Download port** using a USB cable. SwiftIO Feather board has only the download port. SwiftIO board has both download and serial ports, so make sure you connect the correct port.

  src={require('./img/downloadPort.png').default}
  alt="Connect board to computer" width="960"
/>

3. Press the **Download button**. Once pressed, your board will appear as a USB Drive on your computer. There are two buttons on your board. The one labeled "**Download**" or "**DL**" is the correct one.

  src={require('./img/downloadButton.png').default}
  alt="Press download button" width="960"
/>

:::note
Bad quality USB cable or some third-party USB hub may cause connection failure. If the board still fails to connect to your computer, you can refer to [FAQ](./faq.mdx#usb-driver-cant-be-mounted).

4. The onboard RGB LEDs will show the current status of the USB connection. Wait for several seconds until the LED turns to **steady green**.

| LED State | RED | GREEN | BLUE |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| On | USB communication failed | USB connection established | - |
| Slow flashing | Fail to verify bin file | - | - |
| Fast flashing | Fail to open bin file | Detecting USB connection | Detecting SD card |

  src={require('./img/greenLED.png').default}
  alt="Green LED is on" width="960"
/>


## Step 5: Download code to your board

1. Click **MadMachine** / **Build** to build the project. It will generate a file that could run on your board.

<img
  src={require('./img/build.png').default}
  alt="Build the code" width="960"
/>

2. Click **Download** on the MadMachine extension to download the file to your board. 

<img
  src={require('./img/download.png').default}
  alt="Download the code" width="960"
/>

If it says it cannot find the board, you could wait a little longer. Maybe your board is building the connection with your computer. And make sure you have followed step 3 above.


After the code is downloaded to your board successfully, the USB drive will be removed automatically.

Congratulations! The onboard green LED begins to blink per second.
