# Meet your hardware


import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

So far, we have published different hardware: boards, kits, other modules. 
* **Boards**: SwiftIO board and SwiftIO Feather board (no stock due to chip shortage). 
* **Kits**: If you are a newcomer, it's a great way to get started. The kits include a specific board and several modules with their own use. You could start your learning with some interesting projects.
* **Modules**: You could also use some separate modules to create your own projects. There are many online stores for all kinds of modules, like Adafruit and Sparkfun.

:::info
There are no hardware in stock so far. You could subscribe to our mailing list on our website, we'll send a newsletter as soon as our boards and kits are ready for you ðŸ˜†.
