# SwiftIO Maker kit


The SwiftIO Maker kit is a great tool to get started with our SwiftIO board. You can learn the basic electronic concepts and make basic circuits. After you finish the built-in missions, you can create more interesting projects based on what you have learned. 

Most parts adopt grove connectors, which allow you to connect a module using a 4-pin cable instead of 4 separate wires. So don't worry about the wiring.

In our maker kit, you can find different parts for their specific usage. Let's find them out together.

- **SwiftIO board**: control all other parts in the kit and make them respond to your code.
- **Shield**: connect on top of the SwiftIO board to simplify the wiring.
- **Breadboard**: help you to build the circuits. You can place LEDs and resistors on it through the holes, then use jumper wires to connect them to your board.
- **16x2 LCD**: display characters and the values from sensors. It uses I2C protocol to communicate with your board.
- **7-segment display**: display digits or make a countdown.
- **Buzzer**: buzz when you apply a PWM signal to it.
- **Humiture**: measure the temperature and humidity. It uses I2C protocol to communicate with your board.
- **Potentiometer**: change the resistance in your circuit as you twist its shaft. So you can use it to control how other devices work.
- **servo**: change the position of its arm with the PWM signal. If you stick the arm to other objects, you can thus control their movement.
- **LED**: emit light when you set a digital output and have different degrees of brightness when applying a changing PWM signal. 
- **Motor driver module, Motor and Fan blade**: diy a small fan by setting PWM signal. 
- **Button**: control the state of the other modules by pressing or releasing the button.
- **Light sensor**: measure light intensity.
- **4-pin cable**: connect the modules to the shield.
- **Jumper wire**: connect the components to the board.
- **1kÎ© Resistor**: connect with the LED to prevent the current from being too strong.

There is a quick guidebook inside the kit. You can also follow the [project tutorials](../../../projects/swiftio-maker-kit/overview) to learn more about electronics and programming.
