# Learning roadmap

Never be afraid that you have no prior experience. You can follow all these tutorials to get started. Below are our personal suggestions on your learning process.

## To start with 

📣 Choose your guides

☐ If you are a **completely newcomer** or want to **learn systematically**, it’s a good idea to follow this complete guide [Learning A-Z](../learn/introduction) for full knowledge of both language and electronics.

☐ If you have **a little background knowledge**, you could
1. go to [Getting started](getting-started/overview) to learn basic operation,
2. learn with some example in: 
    * [General](../projects/general/getting-started/blink) if you only buy the board and have already all kinds of electronic devices,
    * or [SwiftIO Maker Kit](../projects/swiftio-maker-kit/mission1).

## Helpful knowledge and usage

🔍 Find some [advanced setup](./advanced/overview) if needed while creating your projects.

🔧 Look into the details of your [hardware](./hardware/overview) including boards and kits.

🧩 Check [API references](../reference) during coding.


## Deeper dive into entire platform

💡 Have a deeper understanding of the MadMachine [background](background).

📨 Read [blogs](../blog) which tells details and updates about our project.
