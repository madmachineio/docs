# Download resources to board/SD card

You need to have a non-empty `Resources` folder in your project directory. The MadMachine extension lets you download the entire folder with a single click.

1. Create a **Resources** folder within your project folder to store all necessary files.
2. Click the **Copy Resources** button in the MadMachine extension to copy the entire Resources folder to your desired location.

  src={require('./img/copyResources.png').default}
  alt="Click Copy Resources" width="960"
/>

3. Choose the **destination** for your resources:
* flash: offers around 8MB of space for a filesystem, mounted at `/lfs`. 
* SD card: mounted at `/SD:`.

There are two **modes** to copy resources to the specified location:
* sync: ensures that the Resources folder on the destination becomes an exact replica of the source by copying new files, updating existing ones, and deleting any extra files in the destination.
* merge: updates the Resources folder on the destination with new and changed files from the source while keeping any extra files in the destination.

After a while, your resources will be successfully downloaded.
