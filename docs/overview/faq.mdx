# FAQ

## SwiftIO board reset repeatedly

There is a maximum current limit for the USB port of your devices, while some modules connected to the board may require a larger one. Thus the board reset over and over again.

You can try these ways:

1. Connect the board to the USB port that can output larger power.
2. Connect both the download port and the serial port on the board to USB ports.
3. Use a power bank to supply the board.

## USB driver can't be mounted

This problem may be due to these reasons:

1. Bad-quality USB cable. There are so many bad-quality USB cables in the market. Some of them can only charge your device without communication feature : (
2. Incompatible MicroSD card.
3. Incompatible USB hub or incompatible USB-C to USB-A adapter.
4. There is a known issue with USB compatibility on Mac. There are already a lot of discussions about it on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/gp5b1z/usb_20_issues_on_new_macbook_pro_13_2020/), [apple](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/251356598).

To solve problems 1 and 2, we offer a high-quality USB cable and a Kingston microSD card along with our board. But we still got feedback that the USB drive did not appear. In this situation, there is a temporary solution: use a USB card reader to copy the `.bin` file. At the same time, we'll continue to improve the compatibility of the firmware.
