# 1. Software prerequisite

At first, you could install the MadMachine extension for Visual Studio Code. It allows you to create a new project, compile and download it to your board. 

## Install the extension

1. Open the Visual Studio Code. Click the **Extension** icon on the left activity bar.
2. Enter **MadMachine** in the search box to find the extension in its marketplace.
3. Click the **Install** button.

BTW, **Serial Monitor** provided by Microsoft will be installed automatically. Go [here](../advanced/serial-debug) for a detailed tutorial.


:::info
For advanced users, you could edit your code wherever you like and use the [mm-sdk](../advanced/mm-sdk) to compile your code.
:::

## Set the extension

The extension relies on the mm-sdk to do all its work. You need to indicate its path before using the extension. And it's only done once.

1. [**Download the latest sdk version**](https://github.com/madmachineio/mm-sdk/releases) according to your operating system and **unzip** it.

2. Then come back to the VS code. In the menu bar, select **Code** / **Preferences** / **Settings**.

3. In the Settings, select **Extensions** / **MadMachine**. Enter the **path of the sdk** in the box that matches your operating system. Windows is not supported since we are waiting for the full Window support of Swift language...


import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs
  defaultValue="Mac"
  values={[
    { label: 'Mac', value: 'Mac', },
    { label: 'Linux', value: 'Linux', },
  ]
}>

<TabItem value="Mac">

<img
  src={require('./img/sdkPathMac.png').default}
  alt="Indicate the path of sdk on Mac." width="960"
/>

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Linux">

<img
  src={require('./img/sdkPathLinux.png').default}
  alt="Indicate the path of sdk on Linux." width="960"
/>

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


:::info
Make sure the sdk path is correct, or the extension won't work.

Now, the extension gets readyüëè.

## Quick look

The extension is at the bottom of the Explorer panel. All you need for your project is these three buttons:

- **Build**: build your project after you finish the code. If there are any errors, you can modify your code according to the message in the terminal.
- **Download**: download the generated file after building your project.
- **New Project**: create a new MadMachine project. You will choose the project type and the board type.
