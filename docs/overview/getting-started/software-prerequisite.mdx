# 1. Software prerequisite

At first, you need a tool to deal with your code. You could install the MadMachine extension for Visual Studio Code. It allows you to create a new project, compile and download it to your board. 

## Install the extension

1. In the Visual Studio Code, click the **Extension** icon on the left activity bar.
2. Enter **MadMachine** in the search box to find the extension in its marketplace.
3. Click the **Install** button.

:::info
For advanced users, you could edit your code wherever you like and use the [mm-sdk](../advanced/mm-sdk) to compile your code.

## Set the extension

The extension relies on the mm sdk to do all its work. So you need to indicate its path before using the extension. You only set it the first time you use this extension.

1. [**Download** the latest sdk release](https://github.com/madmachineio/mm-sdk/releases) according to your operating system and unzip it. The versions marked as pre-relase are for internal test and may be unavailable. 

2. Then come back to the VS code. In the menu bar, select **Code** / **Preferences** / **Settings**.

3. In the Settings, select **Extensions** / **MadMachine**. Enter the **path** of the sdk in the box that matches your operating system. Windows is not supported since we are waiting for the Window support of Swift language...

Now, the extension gets readyüëè.

## Quick look

The extension is at the bottom of the Explore panel. All you need for your project is these three buttons:

- **Build**: build your project after you finish the code. If there are any errors, you can modify your code according to the message in the terminal.
- **Download**: download the bin file generated after building your project.
- **New Project**: create a new MadMachine project. You will decide the project type and the board type.
