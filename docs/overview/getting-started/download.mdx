# 4. Downloading project to board

Well, it's time to download the code to your board. The downloading process is different on different types of boards.


import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs
  defaultValue="micro"
  values={[
    { label: 'SwiftIO Micro', value: 'micro', },
    { label: 'SwiftIO board', value: 'swiftio', },
  ]
}>

<TabItem value="micro">

1. **Click the Build button** to build the project. It will generate a file that can run on your board.

  src={require('./img/build.png').default}
  alt="Build the code" width="960"
/>

:::info
During this process, mm-sdk will fetch all the necessary dependencies from GitHub, as shown in the first several lines of the message. So check the internet connection if it fails.
:::

Once the building process is finished, you will see the message Done! in the terminal.

2. **Click the Download button** to download the file to your board. If it's successfully downloaded, you'll see the message Done!.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="swiftio">

1. **Press the Download button**. Once pressed, your board will appear as a USB Drive on your computer. There are two buttons on your board. The one labeled Download is the correct one.

:::note
Bad quality USB cable or some third-party USB hub may cause connection failure. If the board still fails to connect to your computer, you can refer to [FAQ](../faq.mdx#usb-driver-cant-be-mounted).

2. The onboard RGB LEDs will show the current status of the USB connection. Wait for several seconds until **the LED turns to steady green**.

  | LED State     | RED                      | GREEN                      | BLUE              |
  | :------------ | :----------------------- | :------------------------- | :---------------- |
  | On            | USB communication failed | USB connection established | -                 |
  | Slow flashing | Fail to verify bin file  | -                          | -                 |
  | Fast flashing | Fail to open bin file    | Detecting USB connection   | Detecting SD card |
