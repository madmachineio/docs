# 4. Download your project

Well, it's time to download the code to your board.

1. Press the **Download button**. Once pressed, your board will appear as a USB Drive on your computer. There are two buttons on your board. The one labeled "**Download**" or "**DL**" is the correct one.

:::note
Bad quality USB cable or some third-party USB hub may cause connection failure. If the board still fails to connect to your computer, you can refer to [FAQ](../faq.mdx#usb-driver-cant-be-mounted).

2. The onboard RGB LEDs will show the current status of the USB connection. Wait for several seconds until the LED turns to **steady green**.

| LED State | RED | GREEN | BLUE |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| On | USB communication failed | USB connection established | - |
| Slow flashing | Fail to verify bin file | - | - |
| Fast flashing | Fail to open bin file | Detecting USB connection | Detecting SD card |

3. Click **MadMachine** / **Build** to build the project. It will generate a file that could run on your board.

4. Click **Download** on the MadMachine extension to download the file to your board.

/>

If it says it cannot find the board, you could wait a little longer. Maybe your board is building the connection with your computer. And make sure you have followed step 3 above.


After the code is downloaded to your board successfully, the USB drive will be removed automatically.

Congratulations! The onboard green LED begins to blink per secondâœ¨.
