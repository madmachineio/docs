# 3. Hardware preparation

Follow the steps below to connect the board to your computer. 

1. If your project needs other components, you could build the circuit first. And in this case, only the onboard LED is used, so just skip this step.

2. Insert an **SD card** into the slot.

3. Connect the board to your computer through the **Download port** using a USB cable. SwiftIO Feather board has only the download port. SwiftIO board has both download and serial ports, so make sure you connect the correct port.
