# Morse code

You have used an LED to generate an SOS signal and know a little about morse code in previous tutorial. Now you will learn more about it and type messages with it.

## Background

As mentioned before, morse code uses a sequence of dits and dahs (dots and dashes) to represent characters. The duration of the dah is three times the duration of the dit. Here is the chart of morse code.

There are also some requirements for the gap between each code: 
* The gap between morse codes (dits and dahs) within a character equals a dit duration. 
* The gap between letters equals 3 dit duration. 
* And the gap between words equals 7 dit duration. 

In this project, you will send morse code using a button. A long button press represents the dah, and a short press represents the dit.

## Circuit

You will use a button (D1) as an input and an LCD (SPI0) for text display. The button (D1) and the LED (D18) are used for notifications.

## Project overview

* Read digital values from the button.
* Once it's true, the button is pressed. Check how long the button is pressed. 
* If the button press is longer than 300ms, the morse code is a dah, or else it's a dit.
* Once the button is released, store the time after it.
* The threshold for the gap between words is 150ms, and the gap between letters is 60ms. The sound from the buzzer serves as a notification.
* If the morse code for a letter is done, find the corresponding letters and print it.
* Repeat the process until a word is finished. Add a space after the word.

As you can see, the key point of this program is the state of the button. If it's pressed, you need to know if it's a long press or a short press. If it's released, you need to store the gap before the next press to tell if it's the gap between letters or words.
