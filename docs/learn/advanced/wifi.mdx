# Wi-Fi

Welcome to this tutorial where we delve into the world of Wi-Fi. It's undeniable that Wi-Fi has become an essential part of our daily lives. However, have you ever pondered the mechanics behind the seemingly simple act of entering a Wi-Fi password and gaining internet access on your phone or computer? Let's unravel this mystery together.

The ESP32 is a versatile component widely employed in various projects that require Wi-Fi connectivity. We'll explore Wi-Fi utilizing the ESP32 as a Wi-Fi module.


**Learning goals**

* Gain a fundamental understanding of Wi-Fi functionality.
* Master the process of connecting the ESP32 to your Wi-Fi network.
* Learn how to exchange data with public servers through HTTP requests.

## ðŸ”¸Projects

### 1. Joining Wi-Fi

In this project, we'll connect the ESP32 module to Wi-Fi and grab its IP address.

**Project overview**

1. Set up the ESP32 module: reset it and set it to station mode.
2. Use SSID and password for Wi-Fi connection.
3. Display the IP address assigned to the module by your router or alternative access point (AP).

**Example code**

You can download the project source code [here](https://github.com/madmachineio/MadExamples/tree/main/Examples/SwiftIOPlayground/11WiFi/JoiningWiFi).

### 2. Weather

If you've ever used a weather app on your phone, here's an exciting opportunity to build your own. Many weather services out there provide APIs, giving you access to their data. In this project, your goal is to send HTTP requests to a weather service, like openweathermap.org, to retrieve the latest weather updates.



**Project overview**
1. Connect ESP32 to Wi-Fi.
2. Request current weather from the server using an HTTP GET.
3. Decode the JSON-formatted response from the server.
4. Print the weather info.

**Code analysis**

```swift
let response = try esp.httpGet(url: "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=metric&q=YourCity&appid=YourAPIKey", timeout: 30000)
```

This statement initiates an HTTP GET request to the OpenWeatherMap API, fetching current weather data for a specified city in metric units. Make sure to replace `YourCity` with the actual city name and `YourAPIKey` with a valid OpenWeatherMap API key. 

[OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/), a widely-used weather service, offers a free account registration, providing users with an API key necessary for accessing current weather information.

```swift
let weatherInfo = try XJSONDecoder().decode(WeatherInfo.self, from: Array(response.utf8))
```
Decode the JSON response obtained from an HTTP request using predefined Swift structs, in this case, the WeatherInfo struct.

JSON format is commonly applied in web services for transmitting data and in software or hardware for storing settings. This format organizes information into key-value pairs, where keys serve as labels describing the data type, and values store the actual data.

<details>
    <summary> Here is an example JSON data from the OpenWeatherMap. </summary>

```
{
    "coord": {
        "lon": -76.5074,
        "lat": 38.3004
    },

        {

        }
    ],

</details>

We'll utilize [Swift Extra JSON](https://github.com/swift-extras/swift-extras-json) library for data decoding. JSON, inherently key-value paired, aligns seamlessly with properties and values.

* The predined structs in `Weather.swift` conform to the **Decodable** protocol, enabling seamless decoding from an external representation, like JSON.
* **Match JSON keys to corresponding properties** in the structs. If they don't match exactly, use the `CodingKeys` enum to provide custom mappings.
* Use **decoder** to decode JSON data into the predefined `WeatherInfo` struct.

### 3. Temperature data logger

Let's delve into how HTTP POST request works using ThingSpeak as an example. [ThingSpeak](https://thingspeak.com/) is a versatile open-source Internet of Things (IoT) platform designed for collecting, storing, analyzing and visualizing data from IoT devices. 

In this project, we'll focus on sending sensor readings to ThingSpeak via HTTP POST requests. By doing so, we'll be able to observe and analyze how the data changes over time.

**Project overview**

1. Connect ESP32 to Wi-Fi.
2. Read temperature and humidity from sensor.
3. Send sensor data to ThingSpeak using HTTP POST requests.
4. Monitor temperature and humidity trends on the ThingSpeak dashboard.

## ðŸ”¸Background

### Wi-Fi

You know we're all hooked on Wi-Fi for our daily dose, right? Once your computer or phone taps into Wi-Fi, you're set to surf the web. Ever wondered about the behind-the-scenes magic? The internet is this crazy intricate thing, layers upon layers of complexity. Now, don't worry, we won't drag you through a mind-numbing tech marathon. Instead, let's just take a quick peek into how Wi-Fi does its thing and get a basic idea of what's happening.

**Wi-Fi Connection (Neighborhood Move-in)**

1. Connecting to Wi-Fi (Moving into a Neighborhood):
Imagine your computer as a new resident looking for a cozy neighborhood. To join the community, it learns the secret handshake - the Wi-Fi network name (**SSID**) and **password**.

2. Getting an IP address (Getting a Unique Home Address):
Once inside, your computer is assigned a unique home address (**IP address**) by the neighborhood's hosting committee (**router**). This address helps neighbors (devices) recognize each other. The neighborhood is thoughtfully organized with clear boundaries (**subnet mask**), ensuring smooth communication among neighbors.

**Web Exploration (SendingLetters in the Neighborhood)**

1. Entering the **Domain Name** (Craftinga Letter):
Now, let's say you want to send a letter to a pen pal in a different town, just like visiting www.example.com.

2. **DNS** Resolution (Using the Address Directory):
Instead of memorizing complex routes, you consult a friendly address directory (DNS) that translates the pen pal's name into their actual address (IP address).

3. Communicating with the **Gateway** (Neighborhood Post Office):
To send the letter, you visit the neighborhood post office. The postmaster (gateway) checks if your pen pal lives in the same neighborhood (local network). If so, your letter can be hand-delivered. If the pen pal is in a different town (external network), the postmaster (gateway) knows the main roads (external routes) and forwards your letter appropriately.

4. **TCP Connection** (Setting up Chat Line):
Once the letter reaches the pen pal's town, a reliable chat line (TCP connection) is set up, ensuring smooth and efficient communication.

5. **HTTP Request** (Requesting the Pen Pal's Story):
Curious about your pen pal's tales, you ask for their latest story using the universal language of communication (HTTP request).

6. Server **Responds** (Receiving the Tale):
Your pen pal receives the request, finds the story, and sends it back (HTTP response).

7. **Rendering** the Page (Enjoying the Story):
Your imagination (browser) unpacks the story, assembles the sentences, and presents the complete tale on your cozy reading spot (screen).

### ESP32

The **ESP32** is widely favored for various IoT applications, offering both **Wi-Fi and Bluetooth** connectivity. It simplifies complex functionalities like Wi-Fi, TCP/IP, Bluetooth, and HTTP by providing predefined **AT commands**. In simple terms, AT commands are a set of instructions for devices to communicate, often using serial communication. 

In our setup, the ESP32 acts as a Wi-Fi module connected via a **UART** port. To communicate with it, the SwiftIO Micro simply sends these predefined AT commands. 

For an even simpler experience, we've crafted the [**ESP32ATClient**](#api) driver. This lets you operate the module effortlessly by using straightforward APIs, eliminating the need to directly handle those commands.

The ESP32 microcontroller supports three main Wi-Fi modes:
* **Station** (STA): The ESP32 connects to an existing Wi-Fi network (like a router or hotspot) as a client. In this tutorial, we'll dive into station mode.
* **Soft Access Point** (SoftAP): the ESP32 becomes a Wi-Fi access point (AP), providing its own Wi-Fi network. Other devices can connect to it, similar to connecting to a router.
* **Soft Access Point + Station Mode** (STA+AP): this mode combines both Station and SoftAP modes.
