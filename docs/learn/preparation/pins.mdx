# Pins and Peripherals





## Overview

The pins allow devices to communicate with the peripherals of MCUs


## What are the peripherals on MCU?

additional circuits and components built into MCU to perform specific tasks and enhance their capabilities
    
Common peripherals: GPIO, Timer, PWM, ADC, UART, SPI, I2C... (explained in next section)


## How do peripherals work on MCU
    
uses the memory map technique to map all the peripherals in one unified memory space. 

read/write the data from/to the correct address for peripheral control registers


## How do peripherals interact with outside devices?

route internal peripherals into different outside physical pins to connect electrically to the outside world.
    
thus, read or write to a specific register for a peripheral to control the corresponding physical pin


## How are pins organized?

multiplexer/pin multiplexing: 

* The chip provides a lot of functionality but contains a limited number of pins
* configured through software
* a single pin can only perform one function at a time

## Pin name/id


The board pin names are aliases to the MCU pin names.

access a pin by its pin name

several special pins give you access to built-in board hardware, such as an LED and aren't labeled on the board
