# Know your hardware

In this tutorial, you will get to know the hardware that will be your companion throughout this learning journey.

The whole kit - SwiftIO Playground kit consists of two parts: 
* SwiftIO Feather Board - main board

## SwiftIO Feather Board

By connecting it to various hardware components and downloading code onto it, you can interact with the real world, utilizing sensors to detect the environment or generating outputs such as lights and speakers.

While compact in size, the SwiftIO Feather board is incredibly powerful. It is capable of handling all kinds of your projects and can be easily integrated into any of your creative endeavors.

What's more, the SwiftIO Feather board is compatible with the [Adafruit Feather system](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather), allowing you to combine it with the hardware available in their system.

Now, let's delve into the details of the board:

You can connect other hardware to the board through the pins on two sides. This is the pinout diagram of SwiftIO Feather board. It shows the usage of all pins.

As mentioned before, most pins on the board are [multiplexed](./peripherals#how-are-pins-organized), therefore you need to decide the pin's usage in your code.



## SwiftIO Playground

Only with the SwiftIO Feather board, you may still don't know how to start. the expansion board - SwiftIO Playground is specially designed for all newbies to get started. No wire is needed! All modules are directly connected to the shield in the middle.

<img
  src={require('./img/playgroundPins.png').default}
  alt="playground module connection" width="720"
/>

The shield in the middle is for easier connection, and it's the SwiftIO Feather board that communicates with all the modules. After you plug the SwiftIO Feather board into the shield, the circuit is built. Then you could program the SwiftIO Feather board to control the modules.

Let's look into these modules in detail:


| Module               | Quantity | Description                                                        |
| -------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |

<details>
    <summary> You may wonder why some modules have a connector, while others don't.</summary>

These connectors are provided in the event that you wish to disassemble the board. Please note that disassembly is a one-way process, though, and you will not be able to reconnect the parts through the included board. Once apart, use 4-pin cables to connect the module to the shield. Some modules (like LCD) don't have a connector since they require more than 4 wires and don't support 4-pin connectors.

:::caution Attention
Make sure not to connect these modules to the shield through the connectors since they are already connected through the board!

    <summary>How can you disassemble the board?</summary>

The modules can be separated by cutting as shown below.

:::caution Attention
Once again, you cannot put the board back together and once you've broken it apart, you will need to connect any circuits manually using cables.
