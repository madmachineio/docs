# First try


Before diving into the nitty-gritty details, it's always a good idea to get hands-on and try your first project. So, let's kick off your journey by blinking an LED!

## Step 1: Set up software 

At first, you will get started with the software setup process.


1. **Download the latest [mm-sdk](https://github.com/madmachineio/mm-sdk/releases)**. It is used to build and download your project.
2. **Open the Visual Studio Code**. I believe most of you guys have installed it. We've created an extension for it. It is really handy and easy to use.
3. **Install the extension** as shown below:
    1. click the Extensions button on the left bar.
    2. enter the extension name MadMachine in the search box.
    3. click the Install button.

  src={require('./img/install.png').default}
  alt="Install the extension" width="960"
/>


4. **Click ‚öôÔ∏è / Extension Settings** to open the settings.

<img
  src={require('./img/settings.png').default}
  alt="Open the settings window" width="960"
/>


5. **Indicate the mm-sdk location** in the box that matches your operating system. So far, only Mac and Linux are supported. 

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs
  defaultValue="Mac"
  values={[
    { label: 'Mac', value: 'Mac', },
    { label: 'Linux', value: 'Linux', },
  ]
}>

<TabItem value="Mac">

<img
  src={require('./img/sdkPathMac.png').default}
  alt="Indicate the path of sdk on Mac." width="960"
/>

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Linux">

<img
  src={require('./img/sdkPathLinux.png').default}
  alt="Indicate the path of sdk on Linux." width="960"
/>

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note
If you change the location of the SDK later, don't forget to update its path here.

OK, the software gets preparedüëè.

##  Step 2: Create a project

Now, you will start your first project.

1. Click the **Explorer** button on the left bar. Then click the extension **MadMachine** on the bottom to show three buttons. Click **New Project**.

<img
  src={require('./img/create.png').default}
  alt="Create a new project" width="960"
/>

2. Choose the project as an **executable**. Your project will run on the board, so you need an executable. And the projects in the following sections are all executables.

<img
  src={require('./img/projectType.png').default}
  alt="Choose project type" width="960"
/>


3. Choose the board for this project - **SwiftIOMicro**.

<img
  src={require('./img/boardType.png').default}
  alt="Chosse board type" width="960"
/>

4. **Name** the project. You could choose any descriptive name you like for the project. Then press the **Enter** key.

<img
  src={require('./img/projectName.png').default}
  alt="Set project name" width="960"
/>

5. Choose a **location** to store the project and press **Open**.

<img
  src={require('./img/location.png').default}
  alt="Set project location and name" width="960"
/>

Well, the project is created and will open in a new window.

##  Step 3: Write code

Then you will need to edit the code for the project. 

1. Click on the **Blink** / **Sources** / **Blink** / **Blink.swift** to open the file. Your program will start from here marked with `@main`. So you will always edit this file for all your projects.
2. **Copy the code below** into the file. In the [next section](../peripherals/led), you will learn how everything works.

```swift title="Blink.swift" showLineNumbers
import SwiftIO
import MadBoard

@main
public struct Blink {
    public static func main() {
        let led = DigitalOut(Id.BLUE)

        while true {
            led.write(true)
            sleep(ms: 1000)

            led.write(false)
            sleep(ms: 1000)
        }
    }
}
```

<img
  src={require('./img/code.png').default}
  alt="Code" width="960"
/>

##  Step 4: Connect board to computer

**Connect** your SwiftIO Micro to your computer using a USB cable.

<img
  src={require('./img/connect.png').default}
  alt="Connect your board to computer" width="960"
/>


:::info
The SwiftIO Micro supports [XIP](../../../blog/A%20brief%20introduction%20about%20Swift%20in%20embedded%20development#hardware-difference-mmu) now and doesn't require an SD card.

##  Step 5: Download code to the board

1. Click the **Build** button to build your project. Wait until the message **Done** appears on the window.

<img
  src={require('./img/build.png').default}
  alt="click build button" width="960"
/>

2. Click the **Download** button. It will take a few seconds.

<img
  src={require('./img/download.png').default}
  alt="click download button" width="960"
/>

After it's done, the onboard blue LED starts to blinküí°.
