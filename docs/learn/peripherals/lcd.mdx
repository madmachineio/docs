Get ready to bring your projects to life with the power of LCD displays! With their ability to display everything from simple text to complex graphics, LCDs are an essential tool in various electronic projects. In this tutorial, let's dive into the process of working with LCDs. You'll find how easy and fun it can be.


**Learning goals**
* Get a general idea of SPI communication.
* Understand the coordinate system and pixels of LCDs.
* Know more about color: RGB color model, color depth.
* Learn about vector and raster images.
* Learn to draw simple graphics on LCDs.

## üî∏Background

### What is SPI?

In the previous tutorials, you tried I2C communication and should have a basic understanding of communication protocols. Communication protocols enable MCUs to communicate with other devices more easily and efficiently by providing a standardized method for exchanging data. Besides I2C, SPI is also commonly used in embedded systems for MCUs to interact with other devices.

**Serial Peripheral Interface**, SPI for short, is another synchronous communication protocol between devices. It also supports one master with multiple devices, but its speed is much faster than I2C.


**‚ùñ SPI bus**

The SPI bus normally consists of four signal lines:

* **SCK** (serial clock): it carries the **clock signal** generated by the master device to ensure synchronous data transmission.
* **SDI** (serial data in): also called MISO (master in slave out). The **master device receives data** from slave devices through this line.
* **SDO** (serial data out): also called MOSI (master out slave in). The **master device sends data** to slave devices through this line.
* **CS** (chip select): master device controls this signal to **select the specified slave device**. Each slave device needs a CS that connects to the master.

**‚ùñ Device selection**

The CS line allows multiple slave devices to be connected to the same SPI bus, with each device being assigned a unique **CS line**. In most cases, it is **connected to a GPIO pin** on the MCU. This allows the master device to control the CS line by toggling the pin.

At the beginning of an SPI communication, the master device will **set the CS line of the desired slave device to a low state**. This indicates slave device has been selected for communication and allows the master device to communicate with that device independently.

Once the communication is complete, the master device **returns the CS line to the high state to deselect the slave device**. This frees up the SPI bus for other communication, and allows the slave device to return to its idle state.

**‚ùñ Data transmission**

SPI typically uses a full-duplex communication method, which means that **data can be transmitted and received simultaneously**. The master device sends a clock signal on the SCK line for synchronizing data transfer, and on each clock pulse, data is shifted in or out of the two data lines. 

<img
  src={require('./img/dataTransmission.png').default}
  alt="SPI" width="480"
/>

This allows for faster transfer of data compared to I2C, which uses a half-duplex communication method that requires the devices to take turns transmitting and receiving data on a single line.


The **bit order** is an important factor to consider when using the SPI protocol. It refers to the order in which the bits of each byte are transmitted over the bus: **MSB** (most significant bit) first and **LSB** (least significant bit) first. 

For example, for a byte 0b10101010, if in MSB first mode, it would be transmitted as follows: 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, while in LSB first mode, it would be 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1.


**‚ùñ SPI mode**

SPI supports four different modes (0-3) of operation, which are determined by the **polarity and phase of the clock signal**. Its mode determines the timing and order in which data is transmitted and received between the master and slave devices.


* **CPOL** (clock polarity): it depends on the state of SCK when the line is idle. 1 for high and 0 for low.
* **CPHA** (clock phase): it describes the sampling phase relative to the clock signal. If the data is sampled at the first edge of the clock pulse, it is 0. If it's sampled at the second edge, it's 1.

For more details on SPI, you could look at [this article](https://www.analog.com/en/analog-dialogue/articles/introduction-to-spi-interface.html).

### Peripheral - SPI

Many MCUs come with **built-in SPI peripherals** for SPI communication, which makes it easy to **interface with other SPI devices**. 

These peripherals typically include registers that control the various aspects of SPI communication, such as the clock speed, data transfer format, and CS line configuration. To use the SPI peripheral on an MCU, you actually **configure the related SPI registers**.

When programming MCUs to interact with SPI devices, you usually don't need to worry about the low-level details of SPI communication. The [SwiftIO](https://madmachineio.github.io/SwiftIO/documentation/swiftio/spi) library abstracts away the low-level details of SPI communication and provides APIs to perform SPI communication. These APIs typically include functions to initialize and configure the SPI peripheral, as well as send and receive data using the SPI.


To **connect an SPI device to MCUs**, you will need to connect the **MOSI (SDO), MISO (SDI), and SCK pins** on MCUs to the corresponding pins on the device. 

Additionally, the **CS (Chip Select) pin of the SPI device** should be connected to **a GPIO pin on the MCU**, which allows the MCU to control the CS line and select the desired SPI device for communication. The specific GPIO pin used for the CS pin can be configured in the SPI library or driver code.

| MCU        | SPI device |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| MOSI (SDO) | MOSI (SDI) |
| MISO (SDI) | MISO (SDO) |
| SCK        | SCK        |
| a GPIO pin | CS         |

### LCD

There are so many kinds of screens to display characters or graphics. The one you are going to use is a TFT LCD screen (Thin-film-transistor liquid crystal display). It can provide good viewing angles and a high-quality viewing experience in many cases.

The size of an LCD screen is typically measured diagonally from one corner to the opposite corner. This 1.54-inch ST7789 display on your kit has a resolution of 240x240 pixels. 

<img
  src={require('./img/lcdSize.png').default}
  alt="LCD" width="240"
/>

**One pixel is the smallest unit of display** on an LCD screen. Each pixel displays a specific color, and when combined with other pixels, forms a complete image on the screen. **The number of pixels** on a screen is often referred to as the screen **resolution**, and it is typically expressed as the number of pixels in width and height. For example, a screen with a resolution of 240x240 has 240 pixels horizontally and 240 pixels vertically, for a total of 57600 pixels on the screen.

Pixels are arranged in a grid on the screen, with each pixel having its own unique coordinates based on its position in the grid, like (0,0), (6,4) in the image below. **The origin (0,0) is in the upper-left corner**. The x-axis is the horizontal axis, and it runs from left to right. The y-axis is the vertical axis, and it runs from top to bottom. So all pixels for this LCD are from (0,0) to (239,239). 

<img
  src={require('./img/lcd.png').default}
  alt="LCD" width="480"
/>

The **color of each pixel** on this LCD screen is determined by **the combination of red, green, and blue intensities**. The intensity of each color channel is typically represented by a numeric value, such as an 8-bit value ranging from 0 to 255, where 0 represents the absence of the color and 255 represents the maximum intensity of the color. By varying the values in each color channel, different colors can be displayed on the screen.

To display an image or graphic on the screen, the microcontroller must first **determine the pixel data for each pixel**, including its coordinates and the color data. This pixel data is then transmitted to the ST7789 LCD screen over the SPI wires.

Once the screen receives the pixel data, it uses its internal circuitry to display the image or graphic on the screen. The speed and efficiency of the data transfer and display circuitry can have a significant impact on the overall performance and image quality of the display.


## üî∏New concept

### RGB color model

**RGB color model** is a common way to describe colors in many displays, for example, on your computer monitor. 

RGB represents **red**, **green**, and **blue**. They are the basis of colors. The combination of three colors forms more colors: red and green form yellow, green and blue form cyan, blue and red form magenta, the combination of rgb colors form white. By mixing three colors with different intensities, you will get a broad range of colors.

<img
  src={require('./img/RGB.png').default}
  alt="RGB color model" width="240"
/>


### Color depth

**Color depth**, or bit depth, describes **the number of bits to represent a pixel** on the screen. It tells the count of colors that each pixel can display. For each bit, there are two values: 0 or 1. So you could easily get the total number of colors: 2 to the power of the number of bits. A 1-bit color depth has only two colors, such as white and black.

The color depth you will always see nowadays is 16-bit, 24-bit, and 32 bit.

* For **16-bit color**, also called high color, there are 65536 colors in total. The values are divided into 5, 6, 5 bits, representing red, green, and blue.
* **24-bit color** is called true color. There are about 16 million colors. The bits are evenly divided to represent RGB colors: 8 for red, 8 for green, and 8 for blue. 
* **32-bit color**, quite like 24-bit color, uses 8-bit for red, 8-bit for green, and 8-bit for blue. Besides, there is an 8-bit alpha channel to represent the degree of transparency.

The **color code** normally represents colors as a combination of red, green, and blue values. Each color channel is represented by an 8-bit value, which means it can take on 256 different values (2^8). 

<img
  src={require('./img/rgb888.png').default}
  alt="24-bit RGB color" width="480"
/>

* For example, the color white is represented as 0xFFFFFF in hexadecimal because it has the maximum value (255) for each of the three color channels. 
* Black is represented as 0x000000 and has a value of 0 for all three color channels. 
* Red is represented as 0xFF0000 because it has the maximum value for the red channel, and 0 for the green and blue channels, resulting in pure red.


However, the LCD module in this kit supports 16-bit color. So if you are going to define the color for this screen, you need to convert 24-bit color to 16-bit color. Usually, you will take the bits of each color from the most significant bits as below, because they have more effect on the color. So red is represented as 0xF800. You could use the [online converters](http://www.barth-dev.de/online/rgb565-color-picker/) to get 16-bit color values from 24-bit. 

<img
  src={require('./img/rgb565.png').default}
  alt="16-bit RGB color" width="360"
/>

### Image format

When you scale up images several times, you may notice some of the images are just the same and don't lose any quality. These images are called **vector** images. They use points and lines to **create paths based on mathematical formulas**. The fonts used on all websites now are usually in vector format. It will never be blurry as you zoom it in.

While for other images, multiple grids begin to appear as they are zoomed in to a certain degree. These images are called **raster** images, also known as bitmaps. The whole image is **a combination of the smallest units called pixels**. More pixels of the same size means the image is of higher quality. 

<img
  src={require('./img/rasterVector.png').default}
  alt="Raster and vector image" width="320"
/>

In this tutorial, the stuff displayed on the LCD are all raster graphics. There are two commonly used **file formats of bitmap**. 
* **BMP** stands for bitmap. BMP image is uncompressed and stores the color data of all pixels. Therefore it usually has a large file size. 
* **JPG** file uses compression algorithms to deal with similar pixels to reduce the file size. So it needs to be decoded as you open the file. It is a widely used format, so the image viewers on your computer can open it successfully.

These methods to draw on the screen are quite similar:

* **`writeBitmap`** fills a block of pixels on the screen. 
    * You need to tell the **position of the pixels** decided by the starting point, width, and height. So the area of all pixels forms a rectangle. 
    * The pixels of the LCD need 16-bit colors, while the **color values** stored in the array are 8-bit, so the count of the color array equals width x height x 2. 
    
  For example, the color of the rectangle below is represented as 0xF483. So the `color` passed in should be `[0xF4, 0x83, 0xF4, 0x83, 0xF4, 0x83, 0xF4, 0x83, 0xF4, 0x83, 0xF4, 0x83]`.

    <img
        src={require('./img/writeBitmap.png').default}
        alt="Write a bitmap on screen" width="240"
    />

* **`writePixel`** draws a single pixel. It's actually a bitmap whose height and width are 1px. So it needs only one 16-bit color data. If you want to display whatever graphic, like a circle, rectangle, triangle, etc, it is just about the calculation of the coordinates of necessary pixels.
* **`clearScreen`** sets the bitmap to screen size. It needs a UInt16 color value to fill all pixels with the same color.

**Code analysis**

```swift
let spi = SPI(Id.SPI0, speed: 30_000_000)
```
The LCD needs quite a lot of data for display, so the SPI speed needs to be fast enough to get a better view. And the Feather board support 30MHz SPI speed at most. 

The CS pin is not set when initializing the SPI, so it needs to be set when initializing the screen.

```swift
let screen = ST7789(spi: spi, cs: cs, dc: dc, rst: rst, bl: bl, rotation: .angle90)
```
This statement initializes the LCD. It needs several parameters:

* at first, the pins used for SPI communication: **an SPI interface and a CS pin**.
* digital pins for LCD configuration.
* then the size of the screen: width and height. The chip ST7789 supports screens of different sizes. The default size is 240x240.
* at last, the rotation of the screen. The screen rotates by 90 degrees when designing the circuit. So you could set it to `.angle90` to move the origin to the upper left corner.

<img
src={require('./img/LCDRotation.png').default}
alt="LCD Rotation" width="960"
/>

```swift
for y in stride(from: 0, to: screen.height, by: 10) {
    for x in 0..<screen.width {
        screen.writePixel(x: x, y: y, color: red)
    }
}
```

The function `stride(from:to:by:)` makes y start from 0, increased by 10 each time. The maximum value is 240 but is not included, so y is 230 at most. The value for x is 0, 1 ... 238, 239.

Here two for-in loops are used to set corresponding pixels in red one by one. 
* At first, the pixels from (0,0), (10,0) to (239,0) are set, which forms a horizontal line. 
* Then the pixels (0, 10) to (239, 10)... 

```swift
func fillSquare(x: Int, y: Int, width: Int, color: UInt16) {
    for px in y..<(y + width) {
        for py in x..<(x + width) {
            screen.writePixel(x: px, y: py, color: color)
        }
    }
}
```
This function fills an area (rectangle or square) of pixels with the same color. For example, in the image below, the pixels are set in order: (4,3), (5,3), (4,4), (5,4), (4,5), (5,5). 

If you change the order of two loops, the pixel order will change accordingly: (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). However, you cannot perceive this change as the speed is so fast.

<img
  src={require('./img/writeBitmap.png').default}
  alt="Write a bitmap on screen" width="240"
/>

```swift
for color in colors {
    fillSquare(x: x, y: y, width: width, color: color)
    x += width / 2
    y += width / 2
    sleep(ms: 1000)
}
```

In the loop, squares of the same size will show on the screen: red square starts from (0,0), green one from (40,40), blue one from (80,80), white one from (120,120).

After this loop is finished, x and y equal 0 again, and then the animation repeats.


### 2. Rainbow

Fill the screen with rainbow colors.

**Project overview**

* Draw a red rectangle. 
* Then draw an orange one beside it. 
* Similarly, draw rectangles using other rainbow colors. 
* Clear the screen and redraw them on the screen.

### 5. Acceleration visualizer

This project involves reading accelerations from the accelerometer and drawing three bars with a sliding indicator in the appropriate position to represent the acceleration on the x, y, and z axes.


**Project overview**

* Draw three bars to represent the acceleration range on the x, y, z-axis.
* Read current accelerations from the accelerometer.
* Map the accelerations to a specific range to fit within the bar range.
* Draw the sliding indicators in the appropriate position to visualize the acceleration change.


**Example code**
