# Projects

Welcome! After you run the first project on your board, you must want to try more projects. Now let's dive into the projects.

In this section, you will learn by trying some simple projects. You can control your board to do many things and meanwhile learn some basic concepts.


There are three parts in total:

- [**General**](./general/getting-started/overview) - use some commonly used components like a LED, button, buzzer to get familiar with your board. And this part is mainly for those who have some electronic devices in hand and bought only the board.

- [**SwiftIO Maker Kit**](./swiftio-maker-kit/overview) - use the modules in the maker kit to try a dozen missions. You will use these components to build simple circuits and program your board.

- [**SwiftIO Circuit Playgrounds**](./swiftio-circuit-playgrounds) - learn basic knowledge about electronics and Swift language using an all-in-one kit. During learning, you don't need to build the circuits as all modules have been connected to the board.
