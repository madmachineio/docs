import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';


This part is based on the SwiftIO Maker Kit. You will follow all these missions to try the modules one by one. In each mission, you will learn how to build the circuit, how everything works, how to program your board, etc.


At first, you could download all example projects [here](https://github.com/madmachineio/MadExamples). Then follow the missions below. Here is a [guide](../../../overview/advanced/run-example) on running an example project.
