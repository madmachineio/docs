# Mission5_Buzzer

In this project, you will get a buzzer buzzing. Its sound will change as you turn the potentiometer.

## What you need

The parts you will need are all included in the [Maker kit](../../overview/hardware/maker-kit).

- SwiftIO board
- Shield
- Buzzer module
- Potentiometer module
- 4-pin cables


## Circuit

1. Plug the shield on top of your SwiftIO board.
2. Connect the potentiometer module to pin **A0** using a 4-pin cable.
3. Connect the buzzer module to pin **PWM2B** (D10) using a 4-pin cable.

## Example code

Open the project `Mission5_buzzer` in the folder [`MadExamples`](https://github.com/madmachineio/MadExamples)/`Examples`/`MakerKit` if you downloaded the folder.

```swift
// Import the SwiftIO library to use everything in it.
import SwiftIO
// Import the board library to use the Id of the specific board.
import MadBoard

// Initialize the analog pin for the potentiometer.
let a0 = AnalogIn(Id.A0)

// Initialize the PWM output pin for the buzzer.
let buzzer = PWMOut(Id.PWM2B)

while true {
    // Read the input value represented as a percentage.
    let value = a0.readPercent()
    
    // calculate the float value into an integer for the frequency.
    let frequency = Int(400 + 2000 * value)

    // Set PWM parameters.
    buzzer.set(frequency: frequency, dutycycle: 0.5) 
    // Set the duration of the sound.
    sleep(ms: 20) 
}
```

## Background

### Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)

Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) can simulate analog results digitally. The signal is still a square wave that switches between on and off. The duration of the "on-time" is called the **pulse width**. So this technique will change the duration of the high level relative to the low level and switch extremely quickly between them. In this way, it will simulate the voltage between fully open (3.3 volts) and off (0 volts).  

When you repeat this switching pattern with LEDs fast enough, your eyes cannot notice the quick changes between on and off, thus it seems the LED would show different brightness to your eyes. If the change is not quick enough, you may detect it and the LED seems to flicker.

Now come more concepts. A fixed time **period** consists of on and off time. The period is the inverse of the PWM **frequency**. For example, when the PWM frequency is 1000 Hz, one period is 1 millisecond.

The **duty cycle** is the percentage of on-time of output signal during one period. Its range is 0-1. 
* 1 means the voltage is always high. 
* 0 means the voltage is always low. 
* The signal with a 0.5 duty cycle is on for 50% of the time and off for 50% of the time.

### Buzzer

The buzzer can buzz when you apply voltages. That's because the diaphragm inside it can move back and forth as the signal switches between on and off. The vibration causes the surrounding air to vibrate and finally causes the sound you hear.

There are two kinds of buzzers. 
- An **active** buzzer has an internal circuit to create alternating voltage. So you just need to connect it to power. But it can only generate a constant sound since the voltage cannot change.
- A **passive** buzzer needs PWM signals. When the signal switches between on and off, the internal diaphragm moves with it. The frequency of the signal will influence the pitch. A higher frequency will produce a higher pitch. That's how this projects works.


## Code analysis
```swift
import SwiftIO
import MadBoard
```
First, import the two libraries: [SwiftIO](https://madmachineio.github.io/SwiftIO/documentation/swiftio) and [MadBoard](https://github.com/madmachineio/MadBoards/blob/main/Sources/MadBoards/SwiftIOBoard.swift) to use everything in it. **SwiftIO** is used to control the input and output of the board. **MadBoard** defines the pin name of the board.


```swift
let a0 = AnalogIn(Id.A0)
let buzzer = PWMOut(Id.PWM2B)
```
Initialize the analog pin (A0) for the potentiometer and the PWM pin (PWM2B) for the buzzer.

```swift
let value = a0.readPercent()
let frequency = Int(400 + 2000 * value) 
```

Read the analog value in percentage and store it in the constant `value`. The frequency is calculated based on this value. In this case, it's from 400 Hz to 2400 Hz. The bigger the value, the higher the frequency.

```swift
buzzer.set(frequency: frequency, dutycycle: 0.5)
```

Set the PWM signal. The method `set(frequency:dutycycle:)` has two parameters: frequency and duty cycle. Its frequency is related to the analog value above. The duty cycle doesn't matter in this project, and you can set it to 0.5 or any value.
