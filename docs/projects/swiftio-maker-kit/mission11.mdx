# Mission11_Reproduce_Mission10

This mission is similar to Mission10. You will display the temperature on the LCD. But you will use an external library to realize it.


## What you need
The parts you will use are all included in the [Maker kit](../../overview/hardware/maker-kit).

- SwiftIO board
- Shield
- Humiture sensor
- 16x2 LCD
- 4-pin cable


## Circuit

1. Plug the shield on top of the SwiftIO board.
2. Connect the **humiture sensor and the LCD to I2C0**. There are three available pins, you could choose any two.

## Example code

Open the project `Mission11_Reproduce_Mission10` in the folder [`MadExamples`](https://github.com/madmachineio/MadExamples)/`Examples`/`MakerKit` if you downloaded the folder.

## Code analysis

In the previous mission, the code includes the two files to configure the LCD and humiture sensor. However, there is a more convenient way - using libraries and you don't need to add hardware drivers to your projects.

Simply put, a library contains a block of code for specific functionality. You can import it to any of your projects to realize those functionalities.

Now, you will use the online libraries - LCD1602 and SHT3x in your code. They are in the [MadDriver](https://github.com/madmachineio/MadDrivers/tree/main/Sources) that contains all hardware libraries. You need to indicate its location in the file `Package.swift` as above. Thus you don't need to add these files to your project and just import them to your code. They will be downloaded automatically when building your project.

The code in the file `main.swift` is the same.

## Reference

[I2C](https://madmachineio.github.io/SwiftIO/documentation/swiftio/i2c) - use the I2C protocol to communicate with other devices.

[LCD1602](https://github.com/madmachineio/MadDrivers/blob/main/Sources/LCD1602/LCD1602.swift) - display some characters on a 16x2 LCD.

[SHT3x](https://github.com/madmachineio/MadDrivers/blob/main/Sources/SHT3x/SHT3x.swift) - measure temperature and humidity and communicate using I2C protocol.

[MadBoard](https://github.com/madmachineio/MadBoards) - find the corresponding pin ids of your board.
