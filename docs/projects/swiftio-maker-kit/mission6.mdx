# Mission6_Seven_Segment_Display

You can see 7-segment displays everywhere used to display digits, like in a timer, clock, etc. In this mission, you are going to learn how it works and show a number on it. Let's start!


## What you need

The parts you will need are all included in the [Maker kit](../../overview/hardware/maker-kit).

- SwiftIO board
- Shield
- 7-segment display



## Circuit

1. Plug the shield on top of your SwiftIO board.
2. Connect the 7-segment display to the pins reserved for it on the shield, as shown below. Make sure the decimal point is at the bottom.

## Background

### 7-segment display

Why is it called a 7-segment display? Yeah, that's because it contains seven segments ðŸ¤£. They are A, B, C, D, E, F, G, which are 7 LEDs. You can control them separately. 

<img
  src={require('./img/7segment.png').default}
  alt="7-segment display" width="960"
/>

The anodes of 7 LEDs are connected together. You can see a pin for the power connection. If you want A to be illuminated, that pin needs a low voltage.

The image above shows how you can show numbers 0-9 on a seven-segment. For example, to display the number 3, you will turn on A, B, C, D, G, and turn off E, F.


## Code analysis

In this mission, you will separate the code into two files. It makes your code more clear and organized.

- The file `SevenSegment.swift` sets the 7-segment display and provides some easy-to-use functionalities.
- The file `main.swift` shows a digit on the 7-segment display.

### SevenSegment.swift

Let's look at this file in detail. 

```swift
import SwiftIO 
import MadBoard 
```
As always, import the necessary libraries: [SwiftIO](https://madmachineio.github.io/SwiftIO/documentation/swiftio) and [MadBoard](https://github.com/madmachineio/MadBoards/blob/main/Sources/MadBoards/SwiftIOBoard.swift). **SwiftIO** is used to control the input and output of your board. **MadBoard** defines the pin ids.

```swift
final class SevenSegment {
    ...
}
```
Then you will group the code in a class named `SevenSegment`. Briefly speaking, the **class** is like a template to create many instances with similar characteristics. It usually has methods (function in a class) and properties (constant or variable in a class).

A class can be inherited, but with the keyword **final**, it cannot be inherited any longer.

:::note
The class is a reference type. So if you create an instance and assign it to different constants, they all point to the same one. If you change any of the instances, all will change with it. That is why the class is used in your projects. Since the corresponding hardware is unique, any setting will cause changes in the hardware.
:::

```swift
static let a = DigitalOut(Id.D8)
static let b = DigitalOut(Id.D7)
static let c = DigitalOut(Id.D6)
static let d = DigitalOut(Id.D5)
static let e = DigitalOut(Id.D4)
static let f = DigitalOut(Id.D2)
static let g = DigitalOut(Id.D3)
```
Initialize the 7 digital pins. To better identify the segments later, you name these pins as a, b, c... The pins should match the segments, or the final display will go wrong.



The keyword **static** makes these properties belong to the class, rather than to any instance of the class.

```swift
let leds = [a, b, c, d, e, f, g]
```
To simplify the code, put them into an array. In this way, you can iterate them instead of dealing with them one by one manually.

An **array** is a collection of ordered values of the same type. To access its element, you can use its index. The index starts from 0. `led[0]` matches `a` in the array.

```swift
let ledState: [UInt8] = [
    0b00111111, 0b00000110, 0b01011011, 0b01001111, 0b01100110, 
    0b01101101, 0b01111101, 0b00000111, 0b01111111, 0b01101111
]
```
This array stores the LED states of numbers from 0 to 9.

How does it work? There are 7 LEDs in total, so you can use a byte to represent its states. Each bit corresponds to an LED. 1 means the LED is on, 0 means off. The image below shows the digit 0:

- You will start from the least significant bit and reserve that bit for a. 
- For digit 0, all segments need to light on except g. So the last seven bits are all 1.
- The most significant bit doesn't match any LED, and you can leave it as 0. 
- Then you need to tell the computer the type of this data. So add 0b for binary numbers.

```swift
public func print(_ number: Int) {
    ...
}
```
After the preparation above, you are ready to set the 7-segment display.

You will create a method to show the number you pass to it. So it needs only a number as its parameter. The keyword **public** is used for access control.

```swift
let num = number % 10
```
Declare a constant to store the digit to be displayed. Since the 7-segment display can only show one digit, you use the remainder operator %. The number will be divided by 10 to get the remainder. For example, if the number is 45, `num` will be 5.

```swift
let value = ledState[num]
```
The `num` is then used as an index to access the elements in the array `ledState`. In this way, you get the exact value that stores the states of each LED. If `num` is 5, the `value` will be 0b01101101.

```swift
for i in 0..<7 {
    ...
}
```
There are 7 LEDs in total, so you will iterate 7 times using a for-in loop. Here you will use the loop with a numeric range. `..<` is the half-open range operator, which means `i` starts from 0 to 7 but doesn't include 7.

At first, `i` equals 0. After the code inside the brackets is executed, `i` will be 1 and restarts the code. Then repeat the process until all number is reached.

```swift
let state = (value >> i) & 0x01
```
This statement is to get the value of each bit. Let's look at the operators here:

- `>>`: right shift, all bits will move to the right. The bits on the right will be discarded, and 0 will be added to the empty bits on the left.
- `&`: bitwise AND operator, it will calculate each corresponding bit of two data. Only when both two bits are 1, the result will be 1, or it will be 0.

<img
  src={require('./img/bitCalculation.png').default}
  alt="Bit calculation" width="480"
/>

Suppose the `value` is 0b01011011. At first, i=0, the value doesn't shift and is calculated with 0x01, so the `state` will be 1, which represents LED a; when i=1, the `state` equals the last second bit of value, 1, which represents LED b; and so on.

<img
  src={require('./img/state.png').default}
  alt="Calculate the state of each LED" width="960"
/>

```swift
if state == 0 {
    leds[i].write(true)
} else {
    leds[i].write(false)
}
```
After you get the value of the state, that is, you know the state of the LED, it's time to set the output!

The if-else statement is to decide the output voltage. If the value of state equals 0, write `true` to turn off the LED. Or, the pin outputs a low voltage to illuminate the LED. As iterating over each bit, the states of all LEDs will be set.

### main.swift

This file is quite simple since all work related to the 7-segment has been done in the other file. Let's take a quick look.

1. Import the libraries. 
2. Then, of course, set the number you want to display.
3. Create an instance of the class `SevenSegment`, so you can use its method to display the number. 
4. Use dot syntax to access the method and pass the number to it.

Well, it's done ðŸ¥³.

This project uses one way to organize your code. There are still other ways, and you'll look into them later.

## Reference

[DigitalOut](https://madmachineio.github.io/SwiftIO/documentation/swiftio/digitalout) - set whether a digital pin outputs a high or low voltage.
