# Mission8_Servo_Motor

In this mission, you will use another kind of motor, the servo motor. The angle of its arm will change with the potentiometer.



## What you need

The parts you will need are all included in the [Maker kit](../../hardware/maker-kit).

- SwiftIO board
- Shield
- Servo
- Potentiometer module
- 4-pin cable


## Circuit

1. Plug the shield on top of your SwiftIO board.
2. Connect the **potentiometer** module to pin **A0** using a 4-pin cable.
3. Connect the **servo** to the pin PWM4A as below. The servo has three wires: the ground wire is brown, the power wire is red, and the signal wire is orange.

## Example code

Open the project `Mission8_Servo_Motors` in the folder [`MadExamples`](https://github.com/madmachineio/MadExamples)/`Examples`/`MakerKit` if you downloaded the folder.

```swift title="Mission8_Servo_Motors.swift" showLineNumbers
import SwiftIO
import MadBoard

@main
public struct Mission8_Servo_Motor {
    public static func main() {
        let a0 = AnalogIn(Id.A0) // Initialize the analog pin.

        // Each cycle of the signal lasts for 20 milliseconds.
        // The pulse should last between 0.5 and 2.5 milliseconds to activate the servo.
        // With a 0.5ms pulse, the servo will turn to 0 degrees and with a 2.5ms pulse, it will at 180 degrees.
        // In between, it is at an angle between 0-180.
        let servo = PWMOut(Id.PWM4A)

        while true {
            let value = a0.readPercentage() // Read the analog value and return a value between 0.0 and 1.0.
            let pulse = Int(500 + 2000 * value) // Calculate the value to get the pulse duration.
            servo.set(period: 20000, pulse: pulse) // Set the servo position according to the scaled value.

            sleep(ms: 20)
        }
    }
}
```

## Background

### Servo motor

The servo motor can adjust its arm's position according to the signal. You can set PWM output to control it. This servo requires a pulse every 20ms. And the duration of each pulse determines the position of the arm:

  src={require('./img/servo.png').default}
  alt="How PWM drives the servo" width="480"
/>

- If the high voltage lasts for 0.5ms, the arm will be at 0 degrees.
- If the high voltage lasts for 1.5ms, the arm will be at 90 degrees.
- If the high voltage lasts for 2.5ms, the arm will be at 180 degrees.

:::note
This servo needs the pulse to be in the range of 0.5 to 2.5ms. You may also meet other servos that need a pulse in 1 to 2ms.

## Code analysis
```swift
import SwiftIO
import MadBoard
```
First, import the two libraries: [SwiftIO](https://madmachineio.github.io/SwiftIO/documentation/swiftio) and [MadBoard](https://github.com/madmachineio/MadBoards/blob/main/Sources/MadBoards/SwiftIOBoard.swift). **SwiftIO** is used to control the input and output of all boards. **MadBoard** defines the pin name of the board.


```swift
let a0 = AnalogIn(Id.A0)
let servo = PWMOut(Id.PWM4A)
```
Initialize the analog pin A0 for the potentiometer and the PWM pin PWM4A for the servo.

```swift
let value = a0.readPercentage() 
let pulse = Int(500 + 2000 * value)
servo.set(period: 20000, pulse: pulse)
sleep(ms: 20)
```
In the dead loop, read the input value in percentage, so you get a value between 0 and 1.

You will use this method `set(period:pulse:)` to set the PWM. 
* The period is in microseconds, so it is 20000us. 
* The pulse should be the number between 0.5ms to 2.5ms. So the value will be matched into this range by doing some calculations.
