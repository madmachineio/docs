# PWM melody

This example is similar to the previous one. You will make the buzzer to play a small piece of music.

## What you need

- SwiftIO Micro (or SwiftIO board)
- Breadboard
- Buzzer
- Jumper wires

## Circuit

1. Plug the buzzer onto the breadboard.
2. Connect any one leg to the pin GND and the other to the pin **PWM0A**.

## Example code

Open the project `PWMMelody` in the folder [`MadExamples`](https://github.com/madmachineio/MadExamples)/`Examples`/`SimpleIO` if you downloaded the examples.

```swift title="PWMMelody.swift" showLineNumbers
// Enable the speaker to play a simple melody by changing the frequency of PWM output.

// Import the library to enable the relevant classes and functions.
import SwiftIO
import MadBoard

@main
public struct PWMMelody {
    public static func main() {
        // Initialize a PWM output pin that the speaker is connected to.
        let speaker = PWMOut(Id.PWM0A)

        // Specify several frequencies corresponding to each note of the melody. 
        let frequencies = [
            330, 330, 349, 392,
            392, 349, 330, 294,
            262, 262, 294, 330,
            330, 294, 294
        ]

        // Allow the speaker to repeat the melody again and again.
        while true {
            for f in frequencies {
                // Change the frequency and the duty cycle of output to produce each note.
                speaker.set(frequency: f, dutycycle: 0.5)
                sleep(ms: 250)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Code analysis

```swift
let frequencies = [
    330, 330, 349, 392,
    392, 349, 330, 294,
    262, 262, 294, 330,
    330, 294, 294
]
```

The frequencies on the array correspond to the notes of the music. If you want to play other music, you can replace the frequencies according to the music score.
