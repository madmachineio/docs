# Brightness control

In this example, you will use a potentiometer as a LED brightness control. As you rotate the potentiometer, the brightness changes.

## What you need

- SwiftIO Feather board (or SwiftIO board)
- Breadboard
- Potentiometer
- LED
- 330ohm resistor
- Jumper wires


## Circuit

1. Place the potentiometer onto the breadboard. Connect the legs on the left to pin **3V3**, connect the second leg to pin **A0**, and the third leg to pin **GND**.
2. Place the LED onto the breadboard. The long leg (anode) of the LED goes to **PWM0A** through a resistor. The short leg (cathode) connects to **GND**.

## Example code

Open the project `BrightnessControl` in the folder [`MadExamples`](https://github.com/madmachineio/MadExamples)/`Examples`/`SimpleIO` if you downloaded the examples.

```swift title="BrightnessControl.swift" showLineNumbers
// Read the analog input value and use it to set the PWM output in order to change the LED brightness.

// Import the library to enable the relevant classes and functions.
import SwiftIO
import MadBoard

@main
public struct BrightnessControl {
    public static func main() {
        // Initialize an analog input and a digital output pin that the components are connected to.
        let sensor = AnalogIn(Id.A0)
        let led = PWMOut(Id.PWM0A)

        // Allow the LED brightness control all the time.
        while true {
            // Read the input voltage in percentage.
            let value = sensor.readPercent()
            // Light the LED by setting the duty cycle.
            led.setDutycycle(value)
            // Keep the current LED state for 200 milliseconds.
            sleep(ms: 200)
        }
    }
}
```


## Code analysis

```swift
let value = sensor.readPercent()
```

There are three available methods to get analog values in different forms. In this case, you will need `.readPercentage`. It will return a percentage representing the ratio between actual voltage and reference voltage (3.3V). The value can then be used as duty cycle to set the LED brightness.

## Reference

[DigitalOut](https://madmachineio.github.io/SwiftIO/documentation/swiftio/digitalout) - set whether the pin outputs a high or low voltage.

[AnalogIn](https://madmachineio.github.io/SwiftIO/documentation/swiftio/analogin) - read the voltage from an analog pin.

[MadBoard](https://github.com/madmachineio/MadBoards) - find the corresponding pin id of your board.
