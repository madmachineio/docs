title: Blink rate
description: Program your board in Swift to change the blink rate of the LED using a potentiometer.

# Blink rate

In this example, you will use a potentiometer to control the flashing speed of an LED light. It will change as you turn it.

## What you need

- SwiftIO Feather board (or SwiftIO board)
- Breadboard
- Potentiometer
- LED
- 330ohm resistor
- Jumper wires


## Circuit


1. Place the potentiometer onto the breadboard. Connect the legs on the left to pin **3V3**, connect the second leg to pin **A0**, and the third leg to pin **GND**.
2. Place the LED onto the breadboard. The long leg of LED goes to **D1** through a resistor. The short leg connects to **GND**.

## Example code

Open the project `BlinkRate` in the folder [`MadExamples`](https://github.com/madmachineio/MadExamples)/`Examples`/`SimpleIO` if you downloaded the examples.


```swift title="BlinkRate.swift" showLineNumbers
// Read the analog input and use it to set the rate of LED blink.

// Import the library to enable the relevant classes and functions.
import SwiftIO
import MadBoard

@main
public struct BlinkRate {

    public static func main() {
       // Initialize an analog input and a digital output pin that the components are connected to.
        let sensor = AnalogIn(Id.A0)
        let led = DigitalOut(Id.D1)

        // Enable the LED to blink over and over again.
        while true {
            // Read the input voltage in percentage.
            let value = sensor.readRawValue()
            // Change the current LED state.
            led.toggle()
            // Keep the LED on or off for a certain period determined by the value you get.
            sleep(ms: value)
        }
    }
}
```

## Code analysis

```swift
let value = sensor.readRawValue()
```

The method `.readRawValue()` reads the current raw value from the specified analog pin. Since the analog-to-digital converter on the Board has a resolution of 12-bit, the corresponding value would be 0-4095.

```swift
led.toggle()
```

The method `.toggle()`, as the name suggests, changes the output level. If it's high level now, it will be changed to low, and vice versa.

```swift
sleep(ms: value)
```
The function `sleep()` keeps the current state of the LED for a specified time decided by the `value`. It makes sure that the time between each toggle is under control and changes with the potentiometer.

[DigitalOut](https://madmachineio.github.io/SwiftIO/documentation/swiftio/digitalout) - set whether the pin outputs a high or low voltage.

[AnalogIn](https://madmachineio.github.io/SwiftIO/documentation/swiftio/analogin) - read the voltage from an analog pin.
