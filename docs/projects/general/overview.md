If you **have already different electronic components in hand and bought one of our board**, it's a good idea to start here to get familiar with the whole system. So we assume that you have some most frequently-used components, like buttons, LEDs, potentiometers, breadboard, etc. 



1. [Follow the step-by-step guide](../../overview/getting-started/overview.mdx) to get started.
2. Download all [example projects here](https://github.com/madmachineio/MadExamples). 
3. If you are using SwiftIO Micro, just skip this step. Otherwise, you will need to [change the board type](../../../overview/advanced/change-board) of the examples.
4. Follow the guides below and [try the corresponding project](../../../overview/advanced/run-example).
