If you **have already different electronic components in hand and bought one of our board**, it's a good idea to start here to get familiar with the whole system. So we assume that you have some most frequently-used components, like buttons, LEDs, potentiometers, breadboard, etc. 

In the following projects, we use the SwiftIO Feather board for example. 
1. You could download all example projects [here](https://github.com/madmachineio/MadExamples). 
2. If you are using SwiftIO Feather board, just skip this step. Otherwise, you will need to [change the board type](../../../overview/advanced/change-board).
3. Follow the guides below and [try the corresponding project](../../../overview/advanced/run-example).
