- **SwiftIO Micro**: control all other modules.
- **Shield**: connect the SwiftIO Micro. It contains an ESP32 as a Wi-Fi module.
- **LED**: can be toggled on and off, or set to any brightness.
- **Button**: control the circuit as you press or release it. 
- **Potentiometer**: vary resistance connected in the circuit.
- **Buzzer**: produces sounds that are usually for alert or confirmation.
- **Humiture**: measure temperature and humidity.
- **Accelerometer**: detect movement by measuring the acceleration in x, y, and z-axis.
- **USB-Serial Converter**: connect the board to the USB port of another device to transmit serial data.
- **Real-Time Clock** (RTC): read the current time and date.
- **Speaker**: generate sounds or play the audio files back.
- **LCD**: display graphics and images.

With the modules included in the SwiftIO Playground kit, you can create various exciting projects. [The accompanying tutorials](../../learn/introduction) provide a step-by-step guide to cover fundamental concepts using this kit.
